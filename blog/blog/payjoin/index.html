<h2>PayJoin.</h2>
<p>You haven't read any other blog posts here? No worries, here's what
you need to know (<em>unless you're an expert, read them anyway...</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>A utxo is an "unspent transaction output" - a Bitcoin transaction
    creates one or more of these, and each contains a specific amount of
    Bitcoin. Those outputs get "used up" in the transaction that
    spends them (somewhat like physical coins, someone gives you them in
    a payment to you, then you give them to someone else when you spend
    them; bitcoins aren't coins, utxos are coins; only difference is
    physical coins don't get destroyed in transactions).</li>
<li>The fees you have to pay for a Bitcoin transaction depend on how
    many bytes it takes up; this is *somewhat* dominated by how many
    inputs you provide, although there are other factors.</li>
<li>CoinJoin basically means - two or more people provide inputs (utxos)
    to a transaction and co-sign without needing trust, because when
    they sign that the output amounts and addresses are what they
    expect. <strong>Note that CoinJoin requires interaction, almost always.</strong></li>
<li>Traditional "equal-sized" CoinJoin means a bunch of people paying
    <em>themselves</em> the same fixed amount in a single transaction
    (according to the process just mentioned), with the intention that
    nobody can tell which of the equal sized outputs belong to who
    (basically!).</li>
</ul>
<h2>The drawbacks of CoinJoin as implemented</h2>
<p>Current implementations of CoinJoin are of the "equal-sized" variety
(see above). This requires coordination, but it's possible to get a
decent number of people to come together and agree to do a CoinJoin of a
certain fixed amount. The negative is that this kind of transaction is
trivially distinguishable from an "ordinary" transaction, in
particular a payment from one counterparty to another. Here's a typical
Joinmarket CoinJoin (and other implementations are just as, or more,
distinguishable):</p>
<p><img alt="Equal-outs-coinjoin-example" src="/web/20200803124759im_/https://joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/screenshot_from_2019-01-18_15-00-33.png/screenshot_from_2019-01-18_15-00-33-807x433.png">{width="807"
height="433"}</p>
<p>The biggest flag of "this is CoinJoin" is exactly the multiple
equal-value (0.18875417 here) outputs that are the core premise of the
idea, that give the anonymity. Here, you get anonymity in an "anonymity
set" of all participants of <em>this</em> transaction, first, but through
repeated rounds, you <em>kind of</em> get a much bigger anonymity set,
ultimately of all participants of that CoinJoin implementation in the
absolute best scenario. But it's still only a small chunk of Bitcoin
usage generally.</p>
<p>And while this obviously gets better if more people use it, there is a
limit to that thinking: because <strong>all participants are forced to use the
same denomination for any single round</strong>, it isn't possible to fold in
the payments you're doing using Bitcoin as a currency (don't laugh!)
into these CoinJoin rounds (notice: this problem mostly disappears with
blinded amounts).</p>
<p>So a world where "basically everyone uses CoinJoin" is cool for
privacy, but could end up pretty bad for scalability, because these
transactions are <em>in addition to</em> the normal payments.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that these transactions are trivially watermarked means
that, if the blockchain analyst is not able to "crack" and unmix such
transactions, he can at least isolate them in analysis. That's
something; "these coins went from Exchange A to wallet B and then into
this mixset" may be a somewhat negative result, but it's still a
result. There are even noises made occasionally that coins might be
blocked from being sent to certain exchange-type entities if they're
seen to have come from a "mixer" (doesn't matter that CoinJoin is
<em>trustless</em> mixing here; just that it's an activity specific for
obfuscation).</p>
<p>I don't mean to scaremonger - I have used such CoinJoin for years
(measured in the thousands) and will continue to do so, and never had
payments blocked because of it. But this is another angle that must be
borne in mind.</p>
<p>So let's say our primary goal is to minimize the negative privacy
effects of blockchain analysis; can we do better? It's debatable, but
we <em>do</em> have another angle of attack.</p>
<h2>Hiding in a much bigger crowd ... ?</h2>
<p>[One angle is to make your behaviour look more like other, non-coinjoin
transactions]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. (For the
philosophically/abstract inclined people, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803124759/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-steganographic-principle/">this post might be of
interest</a>,
but it sidetracks us here, so - later!). Let's think of the naive way
to do that. Suppose just Alice and Bob make a 2 party CoinJoin:</p>
<p><code>0.05 BTC ---&gt;|   0.05 BTC  3AliceSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.05 BTC ---&gt;|   0.05 BTC  3BobSAddReSs</code></p>
<p>This first attempt is a clear failure - it "looks like an ordinary
payment" <em>only</em> in the sense that it has two outputs (one change, one
payment). But the failure is not <em>just</em> the obvious, that the output
amounts are equal and so "obviously CoinJoin". There's another aspect
of that failure, illustrated here:</p>
<p><code>0.01 BTC ---&gt;|   0.05 BTC  3AliceSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.04 BTC ---&gt;|   0.06 BTC  3BobSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.03 BTC ---&gt;|</code></p>
<p><code>0.03 BTC ---&gt;|</code></p>
<p>This at least is <em>more</em> plausible as a payment, but it shows the
<strong>subset sum</strong> problem that I was describing in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803124759/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinjoinxt/">CoinJoinXT
post</a>
- and trying to solve with CoinJoinUnlimited (i.e. using a Lightning
channel to break the subset sum problem and feed-back the LN privacy
onto the main chain). While the blockchain analyst <em>could</em> interpret
this as a payment, semi-reasonably, of 0.05 btc by one participant, he
could also notice that there are two subsets of the inputs that add up
to 0.05, 0.06. And also splitting the outputs doesn't fundamentally
solve that problem, notice (they'd also have to split into subsets),
and it would anyway break the idea of "looking like a normal payment"
(one payment, one change):</p>
<p><code>0.01 BTC ---&gt;|   0.011 BTC  3AliceSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.04 BTC ---&gt;|   0.022 BTC  3BobSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.03 BTC ---&gt;|   0.039 BTC  3Alice2</code></p>
<p><code>0.03 BTC ---&gt;|   0.038 BTC  3Bob2</code></p>
<p>After you think about this problem for a while you come to the
conclusion - only if there's actually a transfer of coins from one
party to the other is it solved. Hence
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803124759/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinjoinxt/">CoinJoinXT</a>.</p>
<p>But also, hence <strong>PayJoin</strong> - why not actually do a CoinJoin [while you
are making a payment?]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
<p>[]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
<h2>PayJoin advantages</h2>
<p>I'm not sure who first thought of doing CoinJoins (see bullet point at
start) of this particular flavour, but a <a href="https://blockstream.com/2018/08/08/improving-privacy-using-pay-to-endpoint/">blogpost from Matthew
Haywood</a>
last summer detailed an implementation approach which came out of a
technical workshop in London shortly before, and a little later a
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0079.mediawiki">BIP</a>
was put out by Ryan Havar.</p>
<p>The central idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let Bob do a CoinJoin with his customer Alice - he'll provide at
    least one utxo as input, and that/those utxos will be consumed,
    meaning that in net, he will have no more utxos after the
    transaction than before, and an obfuscation of ownership of the
    inputs will have happened [without it looking different from an
    ordinary payment.]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we look in detail at the advantages, it's worth answering my
earlier question ("Why not actually do a CoinJoin while you are making
a payment?") in the negative: it's not easy to coordinate that. It
means that either (a) all wallets support it and have a way for
*anyone* to connect to *anyone* to negotiate this (2-party) CoinJoin
or (b) it's only limited to peer to peer payments between owners of a
specific wallet that has a method for them to communicate. So let's be
clear: this is not going to suddently take over the world, but
incremental increases in usage could be tremendously valuable (I'll
explain that statement shortly; but you probably already get
it).[]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage 1: Hiding the payment amount</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is what will immediately stand out from looking at the idea. Bob
"chips in" a utxo (or sometimes more than one). So the payment
<em>output</em> will be more than the actual payment, and it will be profoundly
unobvious what the true payment amount was. Here's an example:</p>
<p><code>0.05 BTC ---&gt;|   0.04 BTC  3AliceSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.09 BTC ---&gt;|   0.18 BTC  3BobSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.08 BTC ---&gt;|</code></p>
<p>Now, actually, Alice paid Bob 0.1 BTC using 0.09 and 0.05, getting back
0.04 change. But what does a blockchain analyst think? His first
interpretation will certainly be that there is a payment <em>either</em> of
0.04 BTC or 0.18 BTC, by the owner of the wallet containing all the
inputs. Now, it probably seems very unlikely that the <em>payment</em> was 0.04
and the <em>change</em> 0.18. Why? Because, if the payment output were 0.04,
why would you use all three of those utxos, and not just the first, say?
(0.05). This line of reasoning we have called "UIH1" in the comments
to <a href="https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/4551b947789d3216bacfcb7af25e029e">this
gist</a>
(h/t Chris Belcher for the nomenclature - "unnecessary input
heuristic") for the details. To be fair, this kind of deduction by a
blockchain analyst is unreliable, as it depends on wallet selection
algorithms; many are not nearly so simplistic that this deduction would
be correct. But possibly combined with wallet fingerprinting and
detailed knowledge of wallet selection algorithms, it's one very
reasonable line of attack to finding the change output and hence the
payment output.</p>
<p>For those interested in the "weeds" I've reproduced the key points
about this UIH1 and UIH2 (probably more important) including stats
collected by LaurentMT of oxt.me, in an "Appendix" section at the end
of this post.</p>
<p>Anyway, what else <em>could</em> the payment amount be, in the transaction
above? As well as 0.04 and 0.18, there is 0.09 and 0.01. Do you see the
reasoning? <em>If</em> we assume that PayJoin is a possibility, then one party
could be consuming 0.09 and 0.08 and getting back 0.01. And similarly
for other contributions of inputs. In the simplest case, I would claim
there are 4 potential payment amounts if there are only two inputs and
we assume that one of the two is owned by the receiver. For the
blockchain analyst, this is a huge mess.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage 2 - breaking Heuristic 1</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I discussed Heuristic 1 in the <a href="%22https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinjoinxt/">CoinJoinXT
post</a>. Simple
description: people (analysts) assume that all the inputs to any
particular transaction are owned by one wallet/owner; i.e. they assume
coinjoin is not used, usually. Following the overall logic of our
narrative here, it's obvious what the main point is with PayJoin - we
break the heuristic <em>without flagging to the external observer that the
breakage has occurred. </em>This is enormously important, even if the
breakage of the assumption of common input ownership on its own seems
rather trivial (especially if PayJoin is used by only few people), with
only 2 counterparties in each transaction.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage 3 - Utxo sanitization</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This one might not occur to you immediately, at all, but is actually
really nice. Consider the plight of the merchant who sells 1,000 widgest
per day for Bitcoin. At the end of the day he has 1,000 utxos that he
has to spend. Perhaps the next day he pays his supplier with 80% of the
money; he'll have to construct a transaction (crudest scenario) with
800 inputs. It's not just that that costs a lot in fees (it does!); we
can't really directly solve that problem (well - use layer 2! - but
that's another blog post); but we can solve something else about it -
the privacy. The merchant immediately links <em>almost</em> <em>all</em> of his
payments in the 800-input payout transaction - horrible!</p>
<p>But PayJoin really helps this; each payment that comes in can consume
the utxo of the last payment. Here are two fictitious widget payments in
sequence to illustrate; Bob's utxos are bolded for clarity:</p>
<p>[PayJoin 1 - Alice pays Bob 0.1 for a
widget:]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
<p><code>0.05 BTC ---&gt;|   0.04 BTC  3AliceSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.09 BTC ---&gt;|   0.18 BTC  3BobSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.08 BTC ---&gt;|</code></p>
<p>(notice: Bob used up one utxo and created one utxo - no net change)</p>
<p>[PayJoin2 - Carol pays Bob 0.05 for a discount
widget:]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
<p><code>0.01 BTC ---&gt;|   0.02 BTC  3CarolSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.06 BTC ---&gt;|   0.23 BTC  3BobSAddReSs</code></p>
<p><code>0.18 BTC ---&gt;|</code></p>
<p>This would be a kind of snowball utxo in the naive interpretation, that
gets bigger and bigger with each payment. In the fantasy case of every
payment being PayJoin, the merchant has a particularly easy wallet to
deal with - a wallet that only ever has 1 coin/utxo! (I know it's quite
dubious to think that nobody could trace this sequence, there are other
potential giveaways <em>in this case</em> than just Heuristic 1; but with
Heuristic 1 gone, you have a lot more room to breathe, privacy-wise).</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning though that the full snowball effect can damage
the anonymity set: after several such transactions, Bob's utxo is
starting to get big, and may dwarf other utxos used in the transaction.
In this case, the transaction will violate "UIH2" (you may remember
UIH1 - again, see the Appendix for more details on this) because a
wallet <em>probably</em> wouldn't choose other utxos if it can fulfil the
payment with only one. So this may create a dynamic where it's better
to mix PayJoin with non-PayJoin payments.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage 4 - hiding in (and being helpful to) the large crowd</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>"...but incremental increases in usage could be tremendously
valuable..." - let's be explicit about that now. If you're even
reasonably careful, these PayJoin transactions will be basically
indistinguishable from ordinary payments (see earlier comments about
UIH1 and UIH2 here, which don't contradict this statement). It's a
good idea to use decide on a specific locktime and sequence value that
fits in with commonly used wallets (transaction version 2 makes the most
sense). Now, here's the cool thing: suppose a small-ish uptake of this
was publically observed. Let's say 5% of payments used this method.
<strong>The point is that nobody will know which 5% of payments are PayJoin</strong>.
That is a great achievement (one that we're not yet ready to achieve
for some other privacy techniques which use custom scripts, for example;
that may happen after Schnorr/taproot but not yet), because <em>it means
that all payments, including ones that don't use PayJoin, gain a
privacy advantage!</em></p>
<h2>Merchants? Automation?</h2>
<p>The aforementioned
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0079.mediawiki">BIP79</a>
tries to address how this might work in a standardized protocol;
there's probably still significant work to do before the becomes
actualized. As it stands, it may be enough to have the following
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some kind of "endpoint" (hence "pay to endpoint"/p2ep) that a
    customer/payer can connect to encoded as some kind of URL. A Tor
    hidden service would be ideal, in some cases. It could be encoded in
    the payment request similar to BIP21 for example.</li>
<li>Some safety measures on the server side (the merchant/receiver) to
    make sure that an attacker doesn't use the service to connect,
    request, and block: thus enumerating the server's (merchant's)
    utxos. BIP79 has given one defensive measure against this that may
    be sufficient, Haywood's blog post discussed some more advanced
    ideas on that score.</li>
<li>To state the obvious friction point - wallets would have to
    implement such a thing, and it is not trivial compared to features
    like RBF which are pure Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who pays the fees?</h2>
<p>The "snowball effect" described above, where the merchant always has
one utxo, may lead you to think that we are saving a lot of fees (no 800
input transactions). But not true except because of some second/third
order effect: every payment to the merchant creates a utxo, and every
one of those must be paid for in fees when consumed in some transaction.
The effect here is to pay those fees slowly over time. And it's left
open to the implementation how to distribute the bitcoin transaction
fees of the CoinJoin. Most logically, each participant pays according to
the amount of utxos they consume; I leave the question open here.</p>
<h2>Implementation in practice</h2>
<p>As far as I know as of this writing (mid-January 2019), there are two
implementations of this idea in the wild. One is from Samourai Wallet,
called
<a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/stowaway">Stowaway</a>
and the other is in
<a href="https://github.com/Joinmarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/PAYJOIN.md">Joinmarket</a>
as of version 0.5.2 (just released).</p>
<p>I gave a demo of the latter in my last <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803124759/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/payjoin-basic-demo/">post on this
blog</a>.</p>
<p>In both cases this is intended for peers to pay each other, i.e. it's
not something for large scale merchant automation (as per discussion in
previous section).</p>
<p>It requires communication between parties, as does any CoinJoin, except
arguably
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803124759/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/snicker/">SNICKER</a>.</p>
<p>The sender of the payment always sends a non-CoinJoin payment
transaction to start with; it's a convenient/sane thing to do, because
if connection problems occur, or software problems, the receiver can
simply broadcast this "fallback" payment instead.</p>
<p>In Joinmarket specifically, the implementation looks crudely like this:</p>
<p><code>Sender            Receiver</code></p>
<p><code>pubkey+versionrange --&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;-- pubkey and version</code></p>
<p><code>(ECDH e2e encryption set up)</code></p>
<p><code>fallback tx ---&gt;</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;--- PayJoin tx partial-signed</code></p>
<p><code>co-signs and broadcasts</code></p>
<p>Before starting that interchange of course, the receiver must "send"
(somehow) the sender the payment amount and destination address, as well
as (in Joinmarket) an ephemeral "nick" to communicate over the message
channel. Details here of course will vary, but bear in mind that as any
normal payment, there <em>must </em>be some mechanism for receiver to
communicate payment information to the sender.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is another nail in the coffin of blockchain analysis. If 5% of us
do this, it will <em>not</em> be safe to assume that a totally ordinary looking
payment is not a CoinJoin. That's basically it.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>Appendix: Unnecessary Input Heuristics</h3>
<p>The health warning to this reasoning has already been given: wallets
will definitely not <em>always</em> respect the logic given below - I know of
at least one such case (h/t David Harding). However I think it's worth
paying attention to (this is slightly edited from the comment section of
the referenced gist):</p>
<p>[Definitions:]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
<p>"UIH1" : one output is smaller than any input. This heuristically
implies that <em>that</em> output is not a payment, and must therefore be a
change output.</p>
<p>"UIH2": one input is larger than any output. This heuristically
implies that <em>no output</em> is a payment, or, to say it better, it implies
that this is not a normal wallet-created payment, it's something
strange/exotic.</p>
<p>Note: UIH2 does not necessarily imply UIH1.</p>
<p>~~ ~~</p>
<p>So we just have to focus on UIH2. Avoiding UIH1 condition is nice,
because it means that both outputs could be the payment; but in any case
the normal blockchain analysis will be wrong about the payment amount.
If we don't avoid the UIH2 condition, though, we lose the
steganographic aspect which is at least 50% of the appeal of this
technique.</p>
<p>Joinmarket's current implementation does its best to avoid UIH2, but
proceeds with PayJoin anyway even if it can't. The reasoning is
partially as already discussed: not all wallets follow this logic; the
other part of the reasoning is the actual data, as we see next:</p>
<p>[Data collection from LaurentMT:]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
