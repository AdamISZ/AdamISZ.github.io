<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The weekend of April 4th-5th 2020 we had a remote "Lightning
Hacksprint" organized by the ever-excellent Fulmo, one Challenge was
related to "Payment Points" (see
<a href="https://wiki.fulmo.org/index.php?title=Challenges#Point_Time_Locked_Contracts_.28PTLC.29">here</a>;
see lots more info about the hacksprint at that wiki) and was based
around a new innovation recently seen in the world of adaptor
signatures. Work was led by Nadav Kohen of Suredbits and Jonas Nick of
Blockstream; the latter's API for the tech described below can be seen
currently as a PR to the secp256k1 project
<a href="https://github.com/jonasnick/secp256k1/pull/14">here</a>.
The output from Suredbits was a demo as show
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9o4v7Idjno&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>
on their youtube, a PTLC (point time locked contract, see their
<a href="https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/">blog</a>
for more details on that).</p>
<p>I will not focus here on either the proof of concept code, nor the
potential applications of this tech (which are actually many, not only
LN, but also Discreet Log contracts, various design of tumbler and
others), but entirely on the cryptography.</p>
<h2>What you can do with Schnorr adaptors</h2>
<p>Previous blog posts have covered in some detail the concept of adaptor
signatures, how they are simply realizable using the Schnorr signature
primitive. Also noted here and elsewhere is that there are techniques to
create the same effect using ECDSA signature, but involving considerable
additional crypto machinery (Paillier homomorphic encryption and certain
zero knowledge (range) proofs). This technique is laid out in
<a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/attachments/20180426/fe978423/attachment-0001.pdf">this</a>
brief note, fleshed out fully in
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/552">this</a>
cryptographic construction from Lindell, paired with
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472">this</a>
paper on multihop locks (which represents a very important theoretical
step forward for Lightning channel construction). The problem with that
"tech stack" is the complexity in the Lindell construction, as
mentioned.</p>
<p>A recent
<a href="https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf">paper</a>
by Lloyd Fournier represents a very interesting step forward, at least
in a certain direction: it allows "single signer" ECDSA adaptor
signatures. The scare quotes in the previous sentence represent the fact
that the use of such adaptor signatures would not literally be single
signer - it would be in the context of Bitcoin's <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code>,
most typically 2 of 2 multisig, so the same as the current
implementation of the Lightning network, in which a contract is enforced
by having funds controlled by both parties in the contract. Here, what
is envisaged is not a cooperative process to construct a single
signature (aggregated), but each party can individually create adaptor
signatures with signing keys they completely control. That this is
possible was a big surprise to me, and I think others will be unclear on
it too, hence this blog post after a week or so of study on my part.</p>
<p>Let's remember that the Schnorr adaptor signature construction is:</p>
<p>\(\sigma'(T, m, x) = k + H(kG+T||xG||m)x\)</p>
<p>where \(k\) is the nonce, \(x\) is the private (signing) key and
\(T\) is the 'adaptor point' or just adaptor. The left-hand-side
parentheses are important: notice that <strong>you don't need the discrete
log of the point T to construct the adaptor signature</strong>. But you <em>do</em>
need the signing key \(x\). Or wait .. do you?</p>
<p>As I explained last year
<a href="https://x0f.org/web/statuses/102897691888130818">here</a>
it's technically not the case: you can construct an adaptor signature
for signing pubkey \(P\) for which you don't know \(x\) s.t.
\(P=xG\), with a fly in the ointment: you won't be able to predict
the adaptor \(T\) or know its discrete log either (this makes it
un-dangerous, but still an important insight; I was calling this
"forgeability" but more on that later).</p>
<p>How you ask? To summarize the mastodon post:</p>
<p>\(\stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} q, Q=qG, \quad \mathrm{assume}\quad
R+T =Q\)</p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow \sigma' G= R + H(P,Q,m)P\)</p>
<p>\(\stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \sigma' \quad \implies R = s'G -
H(P,Q,m)P \implies T = Q-R\)</p>
<p>Thus anyone can publish an adaptor signature \((T, \sigma')\) on any
message \(m\) for any pubkey \(P\) at any time. It <em>really</em> isn't a
signature.</p>
<p>And equally obvious is that this does not allow the "forger" to
complete the adaptor into a full signature (\(\sigma = \sigma' +
t\)) - because if he could, this would be a way to forge arbitrary
Schnorr signatures!</p>
<p>With the caveat in the above little mathematical vignette aside, we note
that the bolded phrase above is the crucial point: adaptors can be
created by non-secret owners, for secret owners to complete.</p>
<h2>Adaptors in ECDSA with less wizardry</h2>
<p>I was alerted to this trick via <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2019-November/002316.html">this mailing list
post</a>
and the work of the Suredbits guys, in particular Nadav Kohen, who blogs
on payment points, DLCs and related topics
<a href="https://suredbits.com/payment-points-part-1/">here</a>.
The idea can be summarised as "tweak the nonce multiplicatively instead
of linearly". Take the following notation for the base (complete) ECDSA
signature:</p>
<p>\(\sigma = k^{-1}\left(\mathbb{H}(m) + R_{\mathrm{x}}x\right)
\)</p>
<p>Here we're using the most common, if sometimes confusing notation. As
usual \(k\) is the nonce (generated deterministically usually),
\(R=kG\), \(m\) is the message and \(x\) is the private signing
key whose public key by convention is \(P\). Meanwhile
\(R_{\mathrm{x}}\) indicates the x-coordinate of the curve point
\(R\), with the usual caveats about the difference between the curve
order and the order of the finite field from which the coordinates are
drawn (feel free to ignore that last part if it's not your thing!).</p>
<p>Now clearly you cannot just add a secret value \(t\) to the nonce and
expect the signature \(\sigma\) to be shifted by some simple factor.
Multiplication looks to make more sense, since after all the nonce is a
multiplicative factor on the RHS. But it's not so simple, because the
nonce-<em>point</em> appears as the term \(R_{\mathrm{x}}\) inside the
multiplied factor. The clever idea is how to get around this problem. We
start by defining a sort-of "pre-tweaked" nonce:</p>
<p>\(R' = kG\)</p>
<p>and then the real nonce that will be used will be multiplied by the
adaptor secret \(t\):</p>
<p>\(R = kT = ktG\)</p>
<p>Then the adaptor signature will be published as:</p>
<p>\(\sigma' = k^{-1}\left(\mathbb{H}(m) + R_{\mathrm{x}}x\right)
\)</p>
<p>... which may look strange as here the RHS is identical to what we
previously had for the <em>complete</em> signature \(\sigma\). The
difference of course is that here, the terms \(k\) and \(R\) don't
match up; \(R\) has private key \(kt\) not \(k\). And hence we can
easily see that:</p>
<p>\(\sigma = t^{-1} \sigma'\)</p>
<p><em>will</em> be a valid signature, whose nonce is \(kt\).</p>
<p>However, we do not operate in a world without adversaries, so to be sure
of the statement "if I get given the discrete log of \(T\), I will be
able to construct a fully valid \(\sigma\)", we need a proof of that
claim. This is the key innovation, because this can be done <em>very</em>
simply with a proof-of-discrete-log, or a "PoDLE" as was described in
one of the first <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803123741/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/poodle/">blog
posts</a>
here. To prove that \(R'/G = R/T = k\), where we somewhat abuse / to
mean "elliptic curve discrete log", you just create an AND of two
\(\Sigma\)-protocols, using the same commitment (i.e., nonce), let's
call it \(k_2\) and output a schnorr style response \(s = k_2 +
ek\), where the hash e covers both points \(k_2 G\ ,\ k_2 T\) as
has been explained in the just-mentioned PoDLE blog post and also in a
bit more generality in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803123741/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/ring-signatures/">post on ring
signatures</a>.</p>
<p>It's thus intuitive, though not entirely obvious, that an "adaptor
signature" in this context is really a combination of the same idea as
in Schnorr, but with additionally a PoDLE tacked-on:</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<p>an adaptor point \(T\), a message \(m\), a signing key \(x\)</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<p>adaptor signature \((\sigma', R, R')\), adaptor signature PoDLE:
\((s, e)\)</p>
<p>Verification for non-owner of adaptor secret \(T\):</p>
<p>1. Verify the PoDLE - proves that \(R, R'\) have same (unknown)
discrete log w.r.t. \(T, G\) respectively.</p>
<p>2. Verify \(\sigma' R' \stackrel{?}{=} \mathbb{H}(m) +
R_{\mathrm{x}} P\)</p>
<h2>Swapping ECDSA coins with this method</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, if not exclusively, adaptor signatures as originally
conceived, and still here, allow the swap of a coin for a secret (in
that broadcast of a spending transaction necessarily implies broadcast
of a signature which can be combined with a pre-existing adaptor
signature to reveal a secret), and the crudest example of how that can
be used is the coinswap or atomic swap, see
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803123741/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinswaps/">these</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803123741/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">previous</a>
blog posts for a lot of detail on pre-existing schemes to do this, both
with and without the Schnorr signature primitive that was previously
thought to be near-required to do adaptor signatures.</p>
<p>The ECDSA scheme above can be used in a slightly different way than I
had originally described for Schnorr adaptor signatures, but it appears
that was partly just oversight on my part: the technique described below
<em>can</em> be used with Schnorr too. So the advantage here is principally
that we can do it right now.</p>
<p>1. Alice spends into a 2/2 A1 B1 after first negotiating a timelocked
refund transaction with Bob, so she doesn't risk losing funds.</p>
<p>2. Bob does the same, spending into a 2/2 A2 B2 after negotiating a a
timelocked refund tranasction with Alice, so he also doesn't risk, but
his timelock is closer.</p>
<p>3. Alice creates an adaptor \(\sigma_{1}^{'}\) spending with key
A1 to Bob's destination and adaptor point \(T\) for which she knows
discrete log \(t\).</p>
<p>4. Bob verifies \(\sigma_{1}^{'}\) and the associated data
mentioned above, including crucially the PoDLE provided.</p>
<p>5. Bob creates an adaptor \(\sigma_{2}^{'}\) spending with key B2
to Alice's destination and adaptor point \(T\) for which he does
<strong>not</strong> know the \(t\).</p>
<p>6. Alice can now safely complete the adaptor she receives: \(\sigma_2
= t^{-1}\sigma_{2}^{'}\) and co-sign with A2 and broadcast,
receiving her funds.</p>
<p>7. Bob can see on the blockchain (or communicated directly for
convenience): \(t = \sigma_{2}^{'}\sigma_{2}^{-1}\) and use it
to complete: \(\sigma_{1} = t^{-1}\sigma_{1}^{'}\), and co-sign
with B1 and broadcast, receiving his funds.</p>
<h3>Comparisons to other coinswaps:</h3>
<p>This requires 2/2 P1 P2 type scriptPubKeys; these can be p2sh multisig
or p2wsh multisig using, as mentioned, <code>OP_CHECKMULTISIG</code>. Notice that
in a future Taproot/Schnorr world, this will still be possible, using
the linear style adaptor signatures previously described. However in
that case a musig-style combination of keys will almost certainly be
preferred, as it will create transaction styles that look
indistinguishable from single or any other script types. For now, the
system above does share one very valuable anonymity set: the set of
Lightning channel opens/closes, but doesn't share an anonymity set with
the full set of general single-owner ECDSA coins (which includes both
legacy and segwit).</p>
<p>For now, this method has the principal advantage that the only failure
mode is the timelocked backout, which can be a transaction that looks
entirely normal - having a non-zero <code>nLockTime</code> somewhere around the
current block is actually very normal. While the atomic enforcement part
is, just like Schnorr adaptors, entirely invisible. So apart from the
smaller anonymity set (2-2, so mostly LN), it has excellent privacy
properties.</p>
<h2>Reframing adaptors \(\rightarrow\) otVES</h2>
<p>The aforementioned
<a href="https://github.com/LLFourn/one-time-VES/blob/master/main.pdf">paper</a>
of 2019 by Lloyd Fournier is titled "<em>One Time Verifiably Encrypted
Signatures A.K.A. Adaptor Signatures</em>" - at first this new name
(henceforth otVES) seemed a bit strange, but after reading the paper I
came away pretty convinced. Both the conceptual framework is very clean,
but also, this links back to earlier work on the general concept of
Verifiably Encrypted Signatures. Most particularly the work of the same
guys that brought us BLS signatures from bilinear pairing crypto, in
<a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/aggreg.pdf">this
paper</a>
(namely, Boneh, Lynn, Shacham but also Gentry of FHE fame). The context
considered there was wildly different, as Fournier helpfully explains:
this earlier work imagined that Alice and Bob wanted to fairly exchange
signatures that might be useful as authorization for some purpose. To
achieve that goal, they imagined trusted third party acting between
them, and that an encrypted-to-third-party-adjudicator but still
<em>verifiable</em> signature could serve as the first step of a fair protocol,
assuming honesty of that third party. However what makes the Bitcoin
use-case special is that signatures <strong>are useable if and only if
broadcast</strong><em>. </em>All of this coinswap/HTLC/second layer stuff relies on
that property. In this scenario, having not only a VES but an otVES is
exactly desirable.</p>
<p>Why is one-time desirable here? It's a little obtuse. For those
familiar with cryptography 101 it'll make sense to think about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad">one
time
pad</a>.
The absolutely most basic concept of encryption (which also happens to
be perfectly secure, when considered in the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow">spherical
cow</a>
kind of way): take a plaintext \(p\) and a key \(k\), bitstrings of
the exact same length. Then make the ciphertext \(c\):</p>
<p>\(c = p \oplus k\)</p>
<p>and the thing about this that makes it perfect is exactly also something
that can be considered a "bug": the symmetry of the \(\oplus\)
(xor) operation is such that, given both the plaintext and the
ciphertext, the key can be derived: \(k = c \oplus p\). So any
broadcast of \(p\), after an earlier transfer of \(c\) (to Bob,
let's say), means that the secret key is revealed.</p>
<p>The same is true in our adaptor signature or VES scenario: the adaptor
signature \(\sigma'\) is an "encrypted signature", and is
verifiable using the verification algorithm already discussed, by anyone
who has that encrypted signature and the adaptor "public key" which we
called \(T\). Notice how this is analogous to <em>public</em> key encryption,
in that you only need a public key to encrypt; but also notice that the
one-time pad is <em>secret key </em>encryption, which is why the plaintext and
ciphertext are enough to reveal the key (note: more developed secret key
algorithms than OTP handle this problem). This is some kind of hybrid of
those cases. Once the "plaintext" signature \(\sigma\) is revealed,
the holder of the "encrypted" signature \(\sigma'\) can derive the
private key: \(t\).</p>
<p>So hopefully this makes clear why "one-time-ness" is not so much in
itself desirable, as what is implied by it: that the "private key"
(the <em>encryption</em> key, not the <em>signing</em> key, note!) is revealed on one
usage.</p>
<h2>Security properties - deniability, forgeability, validity, recoverability ...</h2>
<p>At a high level, what security properties do we want from these
"encrypted signatures''? I think there's a strong argument to focus
on two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handing over such encrypted signatures should not leak any
    information to any adversary, including the recipient (it may or may
    not be needed to keep the transfer private, that is not considered
    in the model).</li>
<li>Given an encrypted signature for a message and key, I should be able
    to convince myself that when the plaintext signature is revealed, I
    will get the secret key \(t\), or complementary: when the secret
    key \(t\) is revealed, I should be able to recover the plaintext
    signature.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll deal with both of these points in the following subsections.</p>
<h3>Deniability</h3>
<p>The Schnorr version of the otVES is deniable in the specific sense that
given an unencrypted signature, a corresponding encrypted signature for
any chosen key (\(t\)) can be claimed, as was explained
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803123741/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">here</a>
("Deniability" subsection). For anyone familiar with the basic
construction of zero knowledge proofs, this will be immediately
recognized as being the definition of a "Simulator", and therefore
proves that such an adaptor signature/encrypted signature leaks zero
information to recipients.</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe that the same trick does <strong>not</strong> work with
the ECDSA variant explained above:</p>
<p>Given \(\sigma, R\) satisfying \(\sigma R = \mathbb{H}(m)G +
R_{\mathrm{x}}P\) for the verifying pubkey \(P\), you can try to
assert that \(k = tk_2\) but <strong>you have no way to generate a PoDLE for
\(R, R'\) if you don't know k</strong> - this means that such a
"retrofitted" encrypted signature (which by definition <em>includes</em> the
PoDLE) is not possible for a party not knowing the original secret
nonce, and thus the simulator argument (the argument that an external
observer <em>not knowing the secret</em> can create fake transcripts with a
distribution indistinguishable from the real transcripts) is not
available, hence we cannot claim that such encrypted signatures are
fully zero knowledge. More on this shortly.</p>
<h3>Forgeability</h3>
<p>I am abusing terms here, because unforgeability is the central property
of a valid signature scheme, but here let's talk about the forgeability
of an <em>encrypted</em> signature, so perhaps "adaptor forgeability". Here I
mean the ability to create arbitrary encrypted signatures <em>without</em> the
signing key. This was demonstrated as possible for Schnorr in the first
section of this blog post (noting the obvious caveat!). For ECDSA, we
hit the same snag as for 'Deniability'. Without possessing the signing
key \(x\), you want to make the verification \(\sigma' R' =
\mathbb{H}(m)G + R_{\mathrm{x}}P\) pass for some \(R, R', T, R =
tR'\) such that you can prove DLOG equivalence w.r.t. \(G, T\). You
can do this by "back-solving" the same way as for Schnorr:</p>
<p>\(\stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} k^{*}, R=k^{*}G, \quad Q =
\mathbb{H}(m)G + R_{\mathrm{x}}P\)</p>
<p>\(\stackrel{\$}{\leftarrow} \sigma', \quad \Rightarrow \sigma'
R' = Q \Rightarrow R' = (\sigma')^{-1}Q\)</p>
<p>But since this process did <em>not</em> allow you to deduce the scalar \(q\)
s.t. \(Q = qG\), it did not allow you to deduce the corresponding
scalar for \(R'\). Thus you can output a set \(\sigma', R, R'\)
but you cannot also know, and thus prove equivalence of, the discrete
logs of \(R\) and \(R'\).</p>
<p>The previous two sections demonstrate clearly that the otVES
construction for ECDSA is fundamentally different from that for Schnorr
in that it requires providing, and proving a relationship between two
nonces, and this also impacts quite significantly the security arguments
that follow.</p>
<h3>Validity, Recoverability</h3>
<p>These are aspects of the same thing, so grouped together, and they talk
about the most central and unique property for an otVES scheme, but
fortunately it is almost tautological to see that they hold for these
schemes.</p>
<p>The concern it addresses: what if Alice gave Bob an encrypted signature
to a key \(T\) but it turned out that when decrypted with the
corresponding key \(t\), a valid signature wasn't actually revealed.
That this is impossible is called <strong>validity</strong>. The flip side is
<strong>recoverability</strong>: if Alice gave Bob an encrypted signature and then
published the corresponding decrypted signature ("plaintext"), the
secret key for the encryption (\(t\)) must be revealed.</p>
<p>The Schnorr case illustrates the point clearly, see Lemma 4.1 in
Fournier's paper; \(\sigma' = \sigma -t\) in our notation and we
can see by the definition of Schnorr signature verification that this
must hold, given there cannot be another \(t' \ne t\) s.t. \(t'G =
T\) (there is a one-one mapping between scalars mod n and group
points). Recoverability is also unconditionally true in the same way.</p>
<p>For the ECDSA case, it is nearly the same, except: we rely on the PoDLE
between \(R, R'\), which has the same properties itself as a Schnorr
signature, and so the properties hold conditional on the inability to
break ECDLP (because that would allow Schnorr forgery, and thus PoDLE
forgery).</p>
<p>Note how a ECDLP break can obviously destroy the usefulness of all these
schemes, in particular the underlying signature schemes, but even that
does not alter the fact that the Schnorr encrypted signature is valid
and recoverable (though it becomes a mere technicality in that case).</p>
<h3>EUF-CMA for otVES using Schnorr</h3>
<p>EUF-CMA was discussed in the previous blogs on the Schnorr signature and
on ring signatures, in brief it is a technical term for "this signature
scheme is secure in that signatures cannot be forged by
non-secret-key-owners under this specific set of (fairly general)
assumptions".</p>
<p>Proving this for the Schnorr otVES turns out to be a fairly standard
handle-cranking exercise. This is essentially what I have focused on in
previous work as "proving soundness by running an extractor",
including patching up the random oracle. See the above linked post on
the Schnorr signature for more detail.</p>
<p>Note that unforgeability referred to here <strong>is not the same as "adaptor
forgeability" discussed above</strong>. Here we are specifically trying to
prove that access to such encrypted signatures does not help the
adversary in his pre-existing goal of forging <em>real </em>signatures.</p>
<p>So the handle-cranking simply involves adding an "encrypted signature
oracle" to the attacker's toolchest. EUF-CMA[VES] basically refers
to the inability to create signatures on new messages even when you have
access to arbitrary encrypted signatures, as well as arbitrary earlier
<em>complete</em> signatures, again, on different messages.</p>
<p>As Fournier points out here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>EUF-CMA[VES] says nothing about the unforgeability of signature
encryptions. In fact, an adversary who can produce valid VES
ciphertexts without the secret signing key is perfectly compatible. Of
course, they will never be able to forge a VES ciphertext under a
particular encryption key. If they could do that, then they could
trivially forge an encrypted signature under a key for which they know
the decryption key and decrypt it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>... which is the reason for my (I hope not too confusing) earlier
section on "adaptor forgeability". It <em>is</em> actually possible, for
Schnorr, but not ECDSA, to do what is mentioned in the second sentence
above.</p>
<h3>EUF-CMA[VES] for ECDSA</h3>
<p>Here is the most technical, but the most important and difficult point
about all this. In producing an encrypted ECDSA signature you output:</p>
<p>\((\sigma', R, R', m, P), \quad \textrm{DLEQ}(R, R')\)</p>
<p>(while \(m, P\) may be implicit of course), and this means you output
one piece of information in addition to the signature: that two nonce
points are related in a specific way. It turns out that this can be
expressed differently as the Diffie Hellman key of the key pair \((P,
T)\) (or, in Fournier's parlance, the signing key and the encryption
key). That DH key would be \(tP = xT = xtG\). Here's how; starting
from the verification equation for a published encrypted signature,
using the notation that we've used so far:</p>
<p>\(s'R' = \mathbb{H}(m) + R_{\mathrm{x}}P\)</p>
<p>isolate the public key P (this is basically "pubkey recovery"):</p>
<p>\(P = R_{\mathrm{x}}^{-1}\left(s'R' - \mathbb{H}(m)G\right)\)</p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow tP = R_{\mathrm{x}}^{-1}\left(s'tR' -
\mathbb{H}(m)tG\right)\)</p>
<p>\(\Rightarrow xT = tP = R_{\mathrm{x}}^{-1}\left(s'R -
\mathbb{H}(m)T\right)\)</p>
<p>Notice how we - a verifier, not possessing either the nonce \(k\) nor
the secret \(t\) - were able to deduce <em>this</em> DH key because we knew
the DH key of the key pair \((R', T)\) - it's \(R\), which we were
explicitly given. So this, in some sense "breaks" the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption">CDH
assumption</a>:
that given only points on the curve \(A=aG, B=bG\) you should not be
able to calculate the third point \(abG\) (but "breaks" - because
actually we were given a related DH key to start with).</p>
<p>Fournier addresses this point in two ways. First, he argues that
requirement of the CDH problem being hard is not part of the protocols
for which this scheme is useful and that keys are by design one-time-use
in these applications. The more important point though, is that an
attempt is made to show the scheme secure <strong>if the CDH problem is
easy</strong>. A classic example of backwards cryptography logic ;)</p>
<p>The framework for this is non-trivial, and it is exactly the framework
developed by Fersch et al that was discussed in the section on ECDSA in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803123741/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/liars-cheats-scammers-and-the-schnorr-signature/">this</a>
earlier blog post (subsection "What about ECDSA?"). I have not studied
this framework in any detail, only cursorily, and would encourage anyone
interested to at least watch the linked video of Fersch's talk on it,
which was quite interesting. With the addition of the assumption "CDH
is easy", Fournier claims that ECDSA can be said to have this
EUF-CMA[VES] security guarantee, which is intended to prove,
basically, that <strong>the leak of the DH key is the only leak of information
and that the scheme is secure against forgery</strong>. I can't claim to be
able to validate this; I can only say the argument appears plausible.</p></div>
