<h1>CoinJoinXT - a more flexible, extended approach to CoinJoin</h1>
<p>*Ideas were first discussed
<a href="https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/a5b3fcdd8de4575dbb8e5fba8a9bd88c">here</a>.
Thanks again to arubi on IRC for helping me flesh them out.\
*</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We assume that the reader is familiar with CoinJoin as a basic idea -
collaboratively providing inputs to a transactions so that it may be
made difficult or impossible to distinguish ownership/control of the
outputs.</p>
<p>The way that CoinJoin is used in practice is (today mainly using
JoinMarket, but others over Bitcoin's history) is to create large-ish
transactions with multiple outputs of exactly the same amount. This can
be called an "intrinsic fungibility" model - since, although the
transactions created are unambiguously recognizable as CoinJoins, the
indistinguishability of said equal outputs is kind of "absolute".</p>
<p>However, as partially discussed in the earlier blog post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200603010653/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-steganographic-principle/">"the
steganographic
principle"</a>,
there's at least an argument for creating fungibility in a less
explicit way - that is to say, creating transactions that have a
fungibility effect but aren't <em>necessarily</em> visible as such - they
<em>may</em> look like ordinary payments. I'll call this the <em>deniability</em>
model vs the <em>intrinsic fungibility</em> model. It's harder to make this
work, but it has the possibility of being much more effective than the
<em>intrinsic fungibility model</em>, since it gives the adversary (who we'll
talk about in a minute) an additional, huge problem: he doesn't even
know where to start.</p>
<h2>The adversary's assumptions</h2>
<p>In trying to create privacy, we treat the "blockchain analyst" as our
adversary (henceforth just "A").</p>
<p>Blockchain analysis consists, perhaps, of two broad areas (not sure
there is any canonical definition); we can call the first one
"metadata", vaguely, and think of it is every kind of data that is not
directly recorded on the blockchain, such as personally identifying
information, exchange records etc, network info etc. In practice, it's
probably the most important. The second is stuff recorded directly on
the blockchain - pseudonyms (scriptPubKeys/addresses) and amount
information (on non-amount-blinded blockchains as Bitcoin's is
currently; for a discussion about that see this earlier <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200603010653/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-steganographic-principle/">blog
post</a>);
note that amount information includes the implicit amount - network fee.</p>
<p>Timing information perhaps straddles the two categories, because while
transactions are (loosely) timestamped, there is also the business of
trying to pick up timing and perhaps geographic information from
snooping the P2P network.</p>
<p>With regard to that second category, the main goal of A is to correlate
ownership of different utxos. An old
<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~smeiklejohn/files/imc13.pdf">paper</a>
of Meiklejohn et al 2013 identified two Heuristics (let's call them
probabilistic assumptions), of which the first was by far the most
important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heuristic 1 - All inputs to a transaction are owned by the same
    party</li>
<li>Heuristic 2 - One-time change addresses are owned by the same party
    as the inputs</li>
</ul>
<p>The second is less important mainly because it had to be caveat-ed quite
a bit and wasn't reliable in naive form; but, identification of change
addresses generally is a plausible angle for A. The first has been, as
far as I know, the bedrock of blockchain analysis and has been referred
to in many other papers, was mentioned in Satoshi's whitepaper, and you
can see one functional example at the long-existent website
<a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/">walletexplorer</a>.</p>
<p>[But I think it's important to observe that this list is
incomplete.]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}[]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}</p>
<p>I'll now add two more items to the list; the first is omitted because
it's elementary, the other, because it's subtle (and indeed you might
find it a bit dumb at first sight):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Heuristic/Assumption 0</code>: All inputs controlled by only one pubkey
    are unilaterally controlled</li>
<li>Heuristic/Assumption 1: All inputs to a transaction are owned by the
    same party</li>
<li>Heuristic/Assumption 2(?): One-time change addresses are owned by
    the same party as the inputs</li>
<li><code>Heuristic/Assumption 3</code>: Transfer of ownership between parties in
    one transaction implies payment</li>
</ul>
<p>So, "Heuristic/Assumption" because assumption is probably a better
word for all of these generally, but I want to keep the existing
nomenclature, the "?" for 2 is simply because, as mentioned, this one
is problematic (although still worthy of consideration).</p>
<p><strong>Assumption 0</strong>: basically, that if it's not multisig, was never fully
safe; there was always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing">Shamir's secret
sharing</a>
to share shards of a key, albeit that's very rarely used, and you can
argue pedantically that full reconstruction means unilateral control.
But Assumption 0 is a lot less safe now due to the recent
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472">work</a>
by Moreno-Sanchez et al. which means, at the very least, that 2 parties
can easily use a 2-party computation based on the Paillier encryption
system to effectively use a single ECDSA pubkey as a 2-2 multisig. So
this assumption is generally unspoken, but in my opinion is now
generally important (i.e. not necessarily correct!).</p>
<p><strong>Assumption 3</strong>: this is rather strange and looks tautological; I could
have even written "transfer of ownership between parties in one
transaction implies transfer of ownership" to be cheeky. The point, if
it is not clear to you, will become clear when I explain what
"CoinJoinXT" means.</p>
<p>Our purpose, now, is to make A's job harder <strong>by trying to invalidate
all of the above assumptions at once</strong>.</p>
<h2>Quick refresher: BIP141</h2>
<p>This has been discussed in other blog posts about various types of
"CoinSwap", so I won't dwell on it.</p>
<p>Segwit fixes transaction malleability
(<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki">BIP141</a>,
along with BIP143,144 were the BIPs that specified segwit). One of the
most important implications of this is explained directly in BIP 141
itself, to
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#Trustfree_unconfirmed_transaction_dependency_chain">quote</a>
from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Two parties, Alice and Bob, may agree to send certain amount of
Bitcoin to a 2-of-2 multisig output (the "funding transaction").
Without signing the funding transaction, they may create another
transaction, time-locked in the future, spending the 2-of-2 multisig
output to third account(s) (the "spending transaction"). Alice and
Bob will sign the spending transaction and exchange the signatures.
After examining the signatures, they will sign and commit the funding
transaction to the blockchain. Without further action, the spending
transaction will be confirmed after the lock-time and release the
funding according to the original contract.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, if we agree a transaction, then we can fix its txid and sign
transactions which use its output(s). The BIP specifically references
the Lightning Network as an example of the application of this pattern,
but of course it's not restricted to it. We can have Alice and Bob
agree to any arbitrary set of transactions and pre-sign them, in
advance, with all of them having the funding transaction as the root.</p>
<h2>CoinJoinXT - the basic case</h2>
<p>CoinJoin involves 2 or more parties contributing their utxos into 1
transaction, but using the above model they can do the same to a funding
transaction, but then pre-sign a set of more than one spending
transaction. Here's a simple schematic:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">A 1btc ---&gt;</span>
<span class="err">              F (2,2,A,B) --+</span>
<span class="err">B 1btc ---&gt;                 |</span>
<span class="err">                            |</span>
<span class="err">                            +--&gt;[Proposed transaction graph (PTG) e.g. -&gt;TX1-&gt;TX2-&gt;TX3 ..]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In human terms, you can envisage that: Alice and Bob would like to start
to negotiate a set of conditional contracts about what happens to their
money. Then they go through these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>One side proposes F (the funding transaction) and a full graph of
    unsigned transactions to fill out the PTG above; e.g. Alice
    proposes, Bob and Alice share data (pubkeys, destination addresses).
    Note that the set doesn't have to be a chain (TX1->TX2->TX3...),
    it can be a tree, but each transaction must require sign-off of both
    parties (either, at least one 2-2 multisig utxo, or at least one
    utxo whose key is owned by each party).</li>
<li>They exchange signatures on all transactions in the PTG, in either
    order. Of course, they abort if signatures don't validate.</li>
<li>With this in place (i.e. <strong>only</strong> after valid completion of (2)),
    they both sign (in either order) F.</li>
<li>Now both sides have a valid transaction set, starting with F. Either
    or both can broadcast them. [The transactions are <em>all</em> guaranteed
    to occur as long as at least one of them wants
    it]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. Contrariwise, <strong>none</strong> of
    them is valid without F being broadcast.</li>
</ol>
<p>This does achieve one significant thing: <strong>one transaction such as TX2
can transfer coins to, say, Bob's wallet, giving Alice nothing; and yet
we can still get the overall effect of a CoinJoin. In other words,
we've opened up the possibility to violate Heuristic 3 as well as
Heuristic 1, in the same (short) interaction.</strong></p>
<p>This construction works fine if <em>all</em> inputs used in transactions in the
PTG are descendants of F; but this makes the construction very limited.
So we'll immediately add more details to allow a more general use-case,
in the next section.</p>
<h2>Introducing Promises</h2>
<p>If we allowed any of the transactions (TX1, TX2, ...) in the PTG in our
previous example to have an input which did <em>not</em> come from the funding
transaction F, then we would have introduced a risk; if Alice added utxo
UA to, say, TX2, then, before Bob attempted to broadcast TX2, she could
double spend it. This would break the atomicity of the graph, which was
what allowed the crucial additional interesting feature (in bold,
above): that an individual transaction could transfer funds to one
party, without risks to the other. To address this problem, we call
these additional inputs <strong>promise utxos</strong> and make use of <strong>refund
transactions</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">A 1btc ---&gt;</span>
<span class="err">              F (2,2,A,B) ---</span>
<span class="err">B 1btc ---&gt;                 |       +--&gt; external payout 0.5 btc to Bob</span>
<span class="err">                            |       |</span>
<span class="err">                            +-&gt;[TX1 --&gt; TX2 --&gt; TX3 --&gt; TX4]</span>
<span class="err">                                         |       ^</span>
<span class="err">                                         |       |</span>
<span class="err">                                         |       |</span>
<span class="err">                                         |       +--- utxo A1</span>
<span class="err">                                         |</span>
<span class="err">                                         +--&gt; refund locktime M, pay out *remaining* funds to A: 1btc, B: 0.5btc</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In words: if, between the negotiation time and the time of broadcast of
TX3, Alice spends A1 in some other transaction, Bob will still be safe;
after block M he can simply broadcast the presigned refund transaction
to claim the exact number of coins he is owed at that point in the
graph.</p>
<p>The above addresses the case of a single external input being included
in a chain of transactions in the PTG (here, TX1,2,3,4). Extending this,
and generalising to allowing external inputs in many transactions, is
straightforward; we can add such in-PTG backouts at every step,
redeeming all remaining funds to parties according to what they're
owed.</p>
<p>To summarize this section and how it differs from the original, simpler
construction:</p>
<p>Alice and Bob have a choice:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can set up a fully trustless PTG, without promises. They are
    then guaranteed to achieve "all or nothing": either all
    cooperative signing works, then all transactions can be broadcast
    (as long as <em>at least one</em> of them wants to), or nothing
    (including F) is broadcast at all.</li>
<li>They can set up a PTG including promises from one or both parties.
    Now they don't get "all or nothing" but only ensure that the
    transactions that complete are a subset, in order, from the start F.
    To achieve this they add presigned backouts at (probably every)
    step, so that if the chain "breaks" somewhere along, they will
    recover all the funds remaining that are owed to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The tradeoff is: (2) is not perfectly atomic, but it allows the
transaction graph to include utxos from outside of F's ancestory,
particularly useful for privacy applications. In a sequence of 10
coinjoins, you may be happy to risk that TXs 6-10 don't end up
happening, if it doesn't cost you money. Case (2) is more likely to be
of interest.</p>
<h2>Interlude - overview of features of CoinJoinXT</h2>
<p>There's a large design space here.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can have N parties, not just 2.</li>
<li>We can have as many transactions as we like.</li>
<li>We can have a tree with F as root, rather than a chain.</li>
<li>We can have as many promise utxos from any of the N parties as we
    like.</li>
</ul>
<p>A mixture of these features may give different tradeoffs in terms of
<em>intrinsic fungibility</em> vs <em>deniability</em> vs <em>cost</em>; the tradeoff
discussed in the introduction.</p>
<p><strong>Interactivity</strong> - unlike either a CoinSwap of types discussed earlier
in this blog, or doing multiple CoinJoins (to get a better fungibility
effect than just a single one), this only requires one "phase" of
interactivity (in terms of rounds, it may be 3). The two parties
connect, exchange data and signatures, and then immediately disconnect.
(This is what I called no-XBI in the previous <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200603010653/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-half-scriptless-swap/">blog
post</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Boundary</strong> - the adversary A, as was hinted at in the introduction, in
this model, will not necessarily be able to easily see on the blockchain
where the start and end points of this flow of transactions was. To the
extent that this is true, it's an enormous win, but more on this later.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p><img alt="ExampleCJXT" src="../../../../../../20200603010653im_/https:/joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/onchaincontract3.png/onchaincontract3-614x422.png">{width="614"
height="422"}</p>
<p>Here we are still restricting to 2 parties for simplicity of the
diagram. There is still a chain of 4 TXs, but here we flesh out the
inputs and outputs. About colors:</p>
<p>Blue txos are co-owned by the two parties, envisioned as 2 of 2 multisig
(although as originally mentioned, the technical requirement is only
that each transaction is signed by both parties).</p>
<p>Red inputs are <strong>promise utxos</strong> as described in the earlier section.</p>
<p>Each promise has a corresponding backout transaction pre-signed as
output consuming the bitcoins of the
[previous]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} transaction to the one
consuming that promise.</p>
<p>Notice that this example contains two possible setups for each
individual transaction in the chain; it can pay out only to one party
(like TX3 which pays bob 0.6btc), or it can pay "CoinJoin-style"
equal-sized outputs to 2 (or N) parties. Choosing this latter option
means you are consciously deciding to blur the line between the
<em>intrinsic-fungibility</em> model and the <em>deniability</em> <em>model,</em> which, by
the way, is not necessarily a bad idea.</p>
<h2>The return of A - amounts leak.</h2>
<p>As mentioned, our adversary A has a very important problem - he may not
know that the above negotiation has happened, unlike a simple CoinJoin
where the transactions are watermarked as such (and this is particularly
true if Alice and Bob do <em>not</em> use equal-sized outputs). The boundary
may be unclear to A.</p>
<p>So, what strategy <em>can</em> A use to find the transaction graph/set? He can
do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem">subset
sum</a>
analysis.</p>
<p>If Alice and Bob are just 'mixing' coins, so that they are paid out
the same amount that they paid in, I'll assert that subset sum is
likely to work. It's true that A's job is quite hard, since in
general, he would have to do such subset-sum analysis on a huge array of
different possible sets of (inputs, outputs) on chain; but nevertheless
it's the kind of thing that can be done by a professional adversary,
over time. The fact that subset sum analysis is theoretically
exponential time and therefore not feasible for very large sets may not
be relevant in practice.</p>
<p>In our example above it may not be hard to identify the two inputs from
Alice (1btc, 0.3btc) as corresponding to 3 outputs (0.8btc, 0.2btc,
0.3btc), albeit that the latter two - 0.2, 0.3 were part of CoinJoins.
Remember that this was a tradeoff - if we <em>didn't</em> make equal sized
outputs, to improve deniability/hiding, we'd no longer have any
ambiguity there.</p>
<h2>Breaking subset-sum with Lightning</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="../../../../../../20200603010653im_/https:/joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/amtdecorr2.png/amtdecorr2-711x392.png">{width="711"
height="392"}</p>
<p>Here's one way of addressing the fact that A can do subset-sum on such
a privacy-enhancing CoinJoinXT instantiation. The PTG is unspecified but
you can imagine it as something similar to the previous example.</p>
<p>Marked in blue is what the adversary A doesn't know, even if he has
identified the specific transaction/graph set (as we've said, that in
itself is already hard). Subset-sum analysis won't work here to
identify which output belongs to Alice and which to Bob; since 5.5 + 1.5
!= 6.6, nor does 5.4 fit, nor does such an equation fit with Alice's
input 5.8 on the right hand side of the equation.</p>
<p>The trick is that the 1.5 output is actually a <strong>dual funded Lightning
channel</strong> between Alice and Bob. The actual channel balance is shown in
blue again because hidden from A: (0.3, 1.2). If the channel is then
immediately closed we have fallen back to a case where subset sum works,
as the reader can easily verify.</p>
<p>But if, as is usually the intent, the channel gets used, the balance
will shift over time, due to payments over HTLC hops to other
participants in the Lightning network. This will mean that the final
closing balance of the channel will be something else; for example,
(0.1, 1.4), and then subset-sum will still not reveal which of the 2
outputs (5.4, 5.5) belong to Alice or Bob.</p>
<p>At a high level, you can understand this as a <strong>bleed-through and
amplification of off-chain privacy to on-chain.</strong></p>
<p>It's worth noting that you clearly get a significant part of this
effect from just the dual-funded Lightning channel; if you consider
change outputs in such a single funding transaction, you see the same
effect:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Alice</span>
<span class="err">2.46</span>
<span class="err">       -&gt; Lightning funding 0.1</span>
<span class="err">       -&gt; Change 2.41</span>
<span class="err">       -&gt; Change 2.37</span>
<span class="err">2.42</span>
<span class="err">Bob</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's easy to see that there is no delinking effect on the change-outs
<em>if</em> we know that the funding is equal on both sides. However, there's
no need for that to be the case; if the initial channel balance is
(Alice: 0.09, Bob: 0.01) then the change-outs are going to the opposite
parties compared to if the channel funding is (Alice: 0.05, Bob: 0.05).
So this concrete example should help you to understand a crucial aspect
of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Such a fungibility effect is only achieved if the difference between
    the two parties' initial inputs is small enough compared to the
    size of the dual-funded Lightning channel</li>
<li>If the size of the inputs is very large compared to the Lightning
    channel overall size, which currently at maximum is 2**24 satoshis
    (about 0.16btc), then, in order to achieve this obfuscation effect,
    we "converge" to the case of something like a 2-in and 2-out
    equal-sized coinjoin. It's hard for 2 parties to arrange to have
    inputs of equal sizes, and it somewhat loses the deniability feature
    we were going for. (You can easily confirm for yourself that there
    will be no ambiguity if Alice and Bob's inputs are of completely
    different sizes).</li>
</ul>
<p>So how does the picture change if instead of just doing a single
dual-funded Lightning channel, we include it as an output in a
CoinJoinXT structure?</p>
<p>The answer again is deniability. Any contiguous subset of the entire
blockchain has the property of sum preservation, modulo fees: the input
total is \~= the output total. So no particular contiguous subset on the
blockchain flags itself as being such a CoinJoinXT structure - unless
subset sum works for some N subsets (2, as in our examples, or higher).
But with the dual funded Lightning output of the type shown here, at
least for the 2 of 2 case, this doesn't work.</p>
<h2>Remove all traces?</h2>
<p>What's been described up to now doesn't quite achieve the desired goal
of "deniability"; there are still what we might call "fingerprints"
in such a CoinJoinXT structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timing correlation: if we don't use nLockTime on these
    transactions, then one party might choose to broadcast them all at
    once. This is at the least a big clue, although not unambiguous. To
    avoid it, have the pre-signed transactions in the PTG all be given
    specific timelocks.</li>
<li>Shared control utxos. If we use 2 of 2, or N of N, multisig outputs,
    of the current normal p2sh type, then they are observable as such,
    and this could easily help A to find the "skeleton" of such a
    CoinJoinXT structure. Of course, let's not forget that we can do
    CoinJoinXT with various equal sized outputs too, mixing the
    "intrinsic fungibility" and "deniability" approaches together,
    as discussed, so it's not that CoinJoinXT with p2sh multisig
    connecting utxos is useless. But we may want to focus on less
    detectable forms, like Schnorr/MuSig based multisig with key
    aggregation so that N of N is indistinguishable from 1 of 1, or the
    new
    <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472">construction</a>
    that allows an ECDSA pubkey to be effectively a 2 of 2 multisig.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Proof of Concept</strong> - I put together a some very simple <a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/CoinJoinXT-POC">PoC
code</a>;
it only covers something like the above first "Example" with 2
parties. Going through such an exercise in practice at least allows one
to see concretely that (a) the interaction between the parties is very
minimal (sub-second) which is great of course, but it gets a little
hairy when you think about how to set up a template of such a
transaction chain that 2 parties can agree on using whatever utxos they
have available as inputs. A substantial chunk of that PoC code was
devoted to that - there is a general <code>Template</code> class for specifying a
graph of transactions, with parametrized input/output sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Practicality today</strong> - Although it can be done today (see previous),
there are barriers to making this work well. Ideally we'd have Schnorr
key aggregation for multisig, and support for dual funded Lightning
channels for the amount decorrelation trick mentioned. Without either of
those, such a transaction graph on the blockchain will be <em>somewhat</em>
identifiable, but I still think there can be a lot of use doing it as an
alternative to large sets of clearly identifiable CoinJoins.</p>
<p><strong>Cost tradeoffs</strong> - left open here is the tradeoffs in terms of
blockchain space usage for each "unit of fungibility", i.e. how much
it costs to gain privacy/fungibility this way. I think it's almost
impossible to come up with definitive mathematical models of such
things, but my feeling is that, exactly to the extent any
"deniability" is achieved, it's cost-effective, and to the extent
it's not, it's not cost-effective.</p>
<p><strong>Coordination model</strong> - Currently we have "in play" at least two
models of coordination for CoinJoin - Joinmarket's market-based model,
and the Chaumian server model currently championed by
<a href="https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink">ZeroLink</a>.
<strong>CoinJoinXT as an idea is orthogonal to the coordination mechanism</strong>.
The only "non-orthogonal" aspect, perhaps, is that I think the
CoinJoinXT approach may still be pretty useful with only 2 parties (or
3), more so that CoinJoin with only 2/3.</p>
<p>Finally, where should this fit in one's fungibility "toolchest"?
Lightning is <em>hopefully</em> going to emerge as a principal way that people
gain fungibility for their everyday payments. The area it can't help
with now, and probably not in the future due to its properties, is with
larger amounts of money. So you might naturally want to ensure that in,
say, sending funds to an exchange, making a large-ish payment, or
perhaps funding a channel, you don't reveal the size of your cold
storage wallet. I would see the technique described on this blog post as
fitting into that medium-large sized funds transfer situation. CoinJoin
of the pure "intrinsic fungibility" type, done in repeated rounds or
at least in very large anonymity sets, is the other alternative (and
perhaps the best) for large sizes.</p></div>
