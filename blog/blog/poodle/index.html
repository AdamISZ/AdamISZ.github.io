<h3>P(o)ODLE, not POODLE</h3>
<p>This post, fortunately, has nothing to do with faintly ridiculous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE">SSL 3
downgrade
attacks</a>.
Irritatingly, our usage here has no made-up need for the parenthetical
(o), but on the other hand "podle" is not actually a word.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>You're engaging in a protocol (like Joinmarket) where you're using
bitcoin utxos regularly. We want to enforce some scarcity; you can't use
the same utxo more than once, let's say. Utxos can be created all the
time, but at some cost of time and money; so it can be seen as a kind of
rate limiting.</p>
<p>So: you have a bitcoin utxo. You'd like someone else to know that you
have it, <strong>and that you haven't used it before, with them or anyone
else</strong>, <strong>in this protocol,</strong> but you don't want to show it to them. For
that second property (hiding), you want to make a <em>commitment</em> to the
utxo. Later on in the protocol you will open the commitment and reveal
the utxo.</p>
<p>Now, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">cryptographic
commitment</a>
is a standard kind of protocol, usually it works something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">Alice-&gt;Bob: commit: h := hash(secret, nonce)</span>
<span class="err">(do stuff)</span>
<span class="err">Alice-&gt;Bob: open: reveal secret, nonce</span>
<span class="c">Bob: verify: h =?= hash(secret, nonce)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Hashing a secret is <em>not</em> enough to keep it secret, at least in general:
because the verifier might be able to guess, especially if the data is
from a small-ish set (utxos in bitcoin being certainly a small enough
set; and that list is public). So usually, this protocol, with a
large-enough random nonce, would be enough for the purposes of proving
you own a bitcoin utxo without revealing it.</p>
<p>But in our case it doesn't suffice - because of the bolded sentence in
the problem description. You could pretend to commit to <em>different</em>
utxos at different times, simply by using different nonces. If you tried
to do that <em>just with me</em>, well, no big deal - I'll just block your
second use. But you <em>could </em>use the same utxos with different
counterparties, and they would be none the wiser, unless they all shared
all private information with each other. Which we certainly don't want.</p>
<p>Contrariwise, if you ditch the nonce and just use Hash(utxo) every time
to every counterparty, you have the failure-to-hide-the-secret problem
mentioned above.</p>
<p>In case you didn't get that: Alice wants to prove to Bob and Carol and
... that she owns utxo \(U\), and she never used it before. Bob and
Carol etc. are keeping a public list of all previously used commitments
(which shouldn't give away what the utxo is, for privacy). If she just
makes a commitment: Hash(\(U +\) nonce) and sends it to Bob and Carol,
they will check and see it isn't on the public list of commitments and
if not, OK, she can open the commitment later and prove honest action.
But her conversations with Bob and Carol are separate, on private
messaging channels. How can Bob know she didn't use <em>the same utxo as
previously used with Carol, but with a different nonce</em>?</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>This is a bit of a headscratcher; after several IRC discussions, Greg
Maxwell suggested the idea of <strong>proof of discrete logarithm
equivalence</strong> (hence the title), and pointed me at <a href="http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/15758/how-can-we-prove-that-two-discrete-logarithms-are-equal">this
crypo.stackexchange
thread</a>.
It's a cool idea (although note that that description is based on DL
rather than ECDL seen here): "shift" the EC point to a new
base/generator point, so that nobody else can read (crudely put), then
append a Schnorr signature acting as proof that the two points have the
same discrete logarithm (= private key) with respect to the two base
points. In detail, consider a Bitcoin private, public keypair \((x,
P)\) for the usual base point/generator \(G\), and consider a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_up_my_sleeve_number">NUMS</a>
alternative generator \(J\) ( a little more on this later).</p>
<p>$$P = xG$$</p>
<p>$$P_2 = xJ$$</p>
<p>Next, Alice will provide her commitment as \(H(P_2)\) in the
handshake initiation stage of the protocol. Then, when it comes time for
Alice to request private information from Bob, on their private message
channel, she will have to open her commitment with this data:</p>
<p>$$P, U, P_2, s, e$$</p>
<p>Here \(s,e\) are a Schnorr signature proving equivalence of the
private key (we called it \(x\) above) with respect to \(G,J\), but
of course without revealing that private key. It is constructed, after
choosing a random nonce \(k\), like this:</p>
<p>$$K_G = kG$$</p>
<p>$$K_J = kJ$$</p>
<p>$$e = H(K_G || K_J || P || P_2)$$</p>
<p>$$s = k + xe$$</p>
<p>Then Bob, receiving this authorisation information, proceeds to verify
the commitment before exchanging private information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does \(H(P_2)\) equal the previously provided commitment? If yes:</li>
<li>Check that the commitment is not repeated on the public list (or
    whatever the policy is)</li>
<li>Verify via the blockchain that \(P\) matches the utxo \(U\)</li>
<li>\(K_G = sG - eP\)</li>
<li>\(K_J = sJ - eP_2\)</li>
<li>Schnorr sig verify operation: Does \(H(K_G || K_J || P ||
    P_2) = e\) ?</li>
</ol>
<p>Bob now knows that the utxo \(U\) has not been repeated (the simplest
policy) but Alice has not been exposed to a potential public leakage of
information about the utxo. (It should be noted of course! Bob knows the
utxo from now on, but that's for another discussion about Coinjoin
generally...)</p>
<h3>Why an alternate generator point \(J\)?</h3>
<p>Publishing \(H(P_2)\) gives no information about \(P\), the actual
Bitcoin pubkey that Alice wants to use; in that sense it's the same as
using a nonce in the commitment. But it also gives her no degree of
freedom, as a nonce does, to create different public values for the same
hidden pubkey. No one not possessing \(x\) can deduce \(P\) from
\(P_2\) (or vice versa, for that matter) - <strong>unless</strong> they have the
private key/discrete log of \(J\) with respect to \(G\). If anyone
had this number \(x^*\) such that \(J = x^{*}G\), then it would be
easy to make the shift from one to the other:</p>
<p>$$P_2 = xJ = x(x^{*}G) = x^{*}(xG) = x^{*}P$$</p>
<p>and apply a modular inverse if necessary.</p>
<p>This is why the concept of NUMS is critical. The construction of a NUMS
alternate generator is discussed in <a href="https://elementsproject.org/elements/confidential-transactions/">the same CT doc as
above</a>,
and also in <a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/ConfidentialTransactionsDoc/blob/master/essayonCT.pdf">my CT
overview</a>,
at the end of section 2.2. Note I use \(J\) here in place of \(H\)
to avoid confusion with hash functions.</p>
<h3>Code and thoughts on implementation</h3>
<p>I did an abbreviated write up of the concept of this post in <a href="https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/9cbba5e9408d23813ca8#defence-2-committing-to-a-utxo-in-publicplaintext-at-the-start-of-the-handshake">this
gist</a>,
as one of three possible ways of attacking the problem in Joinmarket:
<a href="https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/issues/156">how can we prevent people initiating transactions over and over again
to collect information on
utxos</a>?
This algorithm is not intended as a <em>complete</em> solution to that issue,
but it's very interesting in its own right and may have a variety of
applications, perhaps.</p>
<p>The algorithm was fairly simple to code, at least in a naive way, and I
did it some time ago using Bitcoin's
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1">libsecp256k1</a>
with the <a href="https://github.com/ludbb/secp256k1-py">Python binding by
ludbb</a>.
An initial version of my Python "podle" module is
<a href="https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/blob/90ec05329e06beed0fbc09528ef6fb3d2c5d03ba/lib/bitcoin/podle.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are lots of tricky things to think about in implementing this; I
think the most obvious issue is how would publishing/maintaining a
public list work? If we just want each utxo to be allowed only one use,
any kind of broadcast mechanism would be fine; other participants can
know as soon as any \(H(P_2)\) is used, or at least to a reasonable
approximation. Even in a multi-party protocol like Joinmarket, the utxo
would be broadcast as "used" only after its first usage by each party,
so it would from then on be on what is effectively a blacklist. But if
the policy were more like "only allow re-use 3 times" this doesn't seem
to work without some kind of unrealistic honesty assumption.</p></div>
