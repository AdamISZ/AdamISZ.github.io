<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This post was mostly prompted by a long series of discussions had online
and in person with many people, including in particular Adam Back and
Tim Ruffing (but lots of others!) - and certainly not restricted to
discussions I took part in - about the tradeoffs in a version of Bitcoin
that does actually use Confidential Transactions.</p>
<p>The topic that keeps recurring is: exactly what level of safety against
<em>hidden inflation</em> does CT offer, in principle and in practice; this is
closely related to what level of privacy it offers, too, but the hidden
inflation is what gets people thinking, first and foremost.</p>
<p>My goal here is to explain to people who are not completely up to speed
with what causes this discussion; to explain, in detail but without
assuming <em>too</em> much pre-knowledge, what the heart of the tradeoff is,
and in the last couple of sections, how we might get around it. How we
might "have our cake and eat it" so to speak.</p>
<p><em>You'll find a lot of the ideas in first three sections of this blog
post, although not all of them, in my write up on
<a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/from0k2bp">Bulletproofs</a>
section 3, and I also went over the basics in the early part of my
London talk on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLZ7qVwKalE">Schnorr
signature</a>
(since they're not visible, you'd want to see the
<a href="../../../images/schnorrplus.pdf">slides</a>
for that talk if you watch it).</em></p>
<p><em>You should have </em><em>some</em><em> general idea about what Confidential
Transactions is, in order to understand the second half - in particular
you should understand that amounts are hidden under Pedersen
commitments, although we'll go through some of it here in the early
sections.</em></p>
<h2>Commitments - the basic ideas</h2>
<p>A commitment fixes a value in advance, without revealing it. Think of
flipping a coin and covering it with your hand as part of a gamble or
game. Covering it with your hand means it's invisible. The visibility of
your hand not moving, and pressed against a surface over the coin, on
the other hand, ensures you can't cheat, because you can't flip the coin
under your hand. This is the physical representation of the two ideas of
a commitment; everything that cryptographers call a commitment has those
two properties, but defended by very strong mathematical "guarantees"
(more on those quote marks shortly!), instead of by a crappy physical
analogue like a pressed-down hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Hiding</code> - nobody but the committer can see or infer the actual
    value being committed</li>
<li><code>Binding</code> - the committer can't change the value after the
    commitment is published.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most "vanilla" way to implement this primitive is to use a
cryptographically secure hash function, say \(\mathbb{H}\). You'd
make up a random number \(r\) and combine it with your secret value
\(x\), and the commitment would just be something like
\(\mathbb{H}(x||r)\), where || indicates just concatenating the
data together.</p>
<p>For background, commitments are usually defined in the literature as a
tuple of three algorithms: Setup, Commit and Verify/Open, where the last
one needs the committing party to give what's called the "opening" of
the commitment as input. It should be clear what is meant when I say
that the "opening" of the above commitment is just literally the two
values \(x\) and \(r\). (It's like taking your hand off the coin in
our analogue).</p>
<p>Because (cryptographically secure) hash-functions are
collision-resistant (avoiding technical definitions for brevity here),
you can't open a commitment you already made to \(x\), with a
different value \(x'\), i.e. as committer you can't cheat, because
even though you're free to make your cheating opening operation with any
\(r'\) you like (it wasn't published in advance), you just can't find
any combination \(x',r'\) such that
\(\mathbb{H}(x||r)=\mathbb{H}(x'||r')\). That's why you need a
proper, strong hash function - to make that computationally infeasible.</p>
<h2>Homomorphic commitments</h2>
<p>The strict definition of homomorphism requires going into group theory a
bit, which isn't needed here, but basically a homomorphism should be
thought of as a function that takes you from one group into another
while keeping the group operation intact (so it's closely related to
symmetry). A toy example would be the homomorphism from the group of
integers under addition (\(\mathbb{Z},+)\) to the group of integers
modulo two \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) (a very simple group!: two members: 0,
1; each is self-inverse; 0+1=1+0 = 1, 0+0=1+1 =0). What is that
homomorphism? It's just a function that returns 0 if the input integer
is even, and 1 if the input integer is odd. We lost everything about the
integers except their evenness/oddness but we kept the group operation.
Call that function \(f()\) and we clearly have \(f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)\)
because even + odd = odd, odd + even = odd, even + even = odd + odd =
even.</p>
<p>But homomorphisms need not collapse a larger group into a smaller one,
the "throw away everything except X" can still conceivably mean throwing
away nothing, i.e. mapping from one group to another with the same order
- and the homomorphism that's relevant to this discussion fits that
description: it translates members of the group of integers modulo
\(N\) under addition, to the group of elliptic curve points of order
\(N\), under elliptic curve point addition: \(a \in \mathbb{Z}_N
\ ; a \rightarrow aG\), where \(G\) is the so-called generator
point of the elliptic curve (exactly which point on the curve is taken
for this role is irrelevant, but the definition has to include one, and
we call it \(G\)), and implicit in the notation \(aG\) is the fact
that it means a <em>scalar multiplication</em> of \(G\) by \(a\), i.e.
\(G\) added to itself \(a\) times.</p>
<p>In Bitcoin, the curve in question is secp256k1, but that's not important
here (except perhaps the fact that \(N\) is prime, meaning both groups
are isomorphic to the cyclic group of order \(N\)).</p>
<p>So this is all getting technical, but all it really boils down to is
\((a+b)G = aG + bG\) is an equation that holds, here.</p>
<p>What about commitments? We can treat the above homomorphism as <em>similar</em>
to a cryptographic hash function, in that we can <em>assume</em> that it's not
possible to derive the integer \(a\) given only the curve point
\(aG\) - this assumes that the "elliptic curve discrete logarithm
problem" is hard (ECDLP for short; also, that's kind of the definition
of that problem).</p>
<p>In making that assumption, we can go ahead and apply the same paradigm:
take a random \(r\) for hiding, then take a second generator point
\(H\) and write our commitment as \(xG + rH\) (addition not
concatenation; publishing the two curve points separately would defeat
the purpose; \(r\) is supposed to be helping to hide \(x\)!).</p>
<p>And we note how the homomorphism between an integer and the scalar
multiple of \(G\) by that integer carries over to this composite case
of the sum of two points: \(x_{1}G + r_{1}H + x_{2}G + r_{2}H =
(x_{1}+x_{2})G + (r_{1}+r_{2})H\).</p>
<p>So it means the commitments, which we can denote \(C(x, r)\) for
brevity, <strong>are homomorphic</strong> too. The sum of two commitments is equal to
the commitment to the sum (in this sentence, notice how "sum" refers to
the sum of two integers; but the homomorphism allows that to "carry
over" to "sum" as in elliptic curve point addition). Algebraically we
can condense it to: \(C(x_1,r_1)+C(x_2,r_2) =
C(x_{1}+x_{2},r_{1}+r_{2})\).</p>
<p>This specific form of commitment is known as the <strong>Pedersen
commitment</strong>. It is most commonly referred to in the finite field, non
elliptic curve form (where \(C=g^{x}h^{r}\) rather than \(C=xG +
rH\)), but it's the same thing.</p>
<p>And to re-emphasise what at this point should be obvious - <strong>none</strong> of
the above applies to commitments built with cryptographic hash
functions.</p>
<h2>Imperfect commitments</h2>
<p>The first imperfection in the idea above of the Pedersen commitment: the
second generator point \(H\). In practice it has been calculated in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_up_my_sleeve_number">NUMS</a>
way, using some kind of hash of the defined generator point \(G\). The
idea is that if this hash function \(\mathbb{H}\) is secure as
described above, \(H\) cannot be reverse-engineered such that its
discrete log (that's to say, \(\gamma\) s.t. \(H=\gamma G\)). And
while this seems like a side-note, we can use this to lead in to the
subtleties which are the main topic of this blog post.</p>
<p>Consider (and this is an excellent exercise for those <em>somewhat</em>
familiar with basic elliptic curve operations as used in Bitcoin and
similar, but not yet seasoned in it): if you secretly knew that
\(\gamma\) and no one else did, and Pedersen commitments were being
used, how could you use this knowledge to gain advantage?</p>
<p>(Spoiler space)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The answer is that the a commitment would lose its <strong>binding</strong> property.
Remember: the binding property is the defence the receiver/verifier of
the commitment has against the creator/committer. So you would be able
to make a commitment randomly - just take any random "private key", call
it \(y\), and publish its "public key" point \(yG\) as \(C\). Then
when asked to verify later, you could pretend that you had bound this
commitment to any \(x\) as follows: Take your newly chosen \(x\),
and calculate what \(r\) has to be for that to work:</p>
<p>\(xG + rH = C\)
\(xG + r\gamma G = yG\)
\(\therefore\)
\(r = \gamma^{-1}(y-x)\)</p>
<p>There are two thoughts that may spring out of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Pedersen commitment then, is only sound in as much as the relative
    discrete log between \(H\) and \(G\) is unknown. And as is often
    discussed, the aforementioned ECDLP is almost certainly broken by a
    sufficiently powerful quantum computer (although there might
    conceivably other ways to compute a discrete log quickly, as yet
    unknown to mathematicians). We say that Pedersen commitments are
    only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">computationally
    binding</span> - this means, only binding inasmuch as breaking their
    binding requires an unrealistic amount of computational power - to
    an adversary with infinite computing power, they are <strong>not</strong>
    binding, at all.</li>
<li>You may think - what about hiding? Surely knowing this "secret
    unlocking key" \(\gamma\) can break that as well. The answer is
    an emphatic <strong>no</strong> - but what might be really surprising is: <em>the
    answer is no in the case of hiding for exactly the same reason that
    the answer is yes, in the case of binding!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I'm first going to explain that formally, but then we'll take a step
back, and use a picture and perhaps some examples to flesh out what's
really going on here, because it's the heart of the story we're telling.</p>
<p>The reason hiding is not lost is because an adversary on the
receiving/verifying side who wants to "sneak peek" inside \(C\) to
find out the real \(x\) faces an insurmountable problem: <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">there isn't only one answer!</span>.
If the answer is \(x\) then the \(r\) value is, as already
explained, \(\gamma^{-1}(y-x)\). Remember, a computationally unbound
attacker can find those discrete logs - can get \(y\) from \(C\),
and can get \(\gamma\) from \(H\). So <em>any</em> \(x\) will have a
corresponding \(r\). And of course you can flip it backwards - if he
fixes a particular \(r\) he can get the corresponding \(x\). Where
is this slipperiness coming from? What's it's fundamental cause?</p>
<p>Think about functions. They take inputs to outputs of course, and we
generalise by talking about input spaces and output spaces (by "space"
here I mean something like "the set of all..."). The technical terms
used are domain/range and sometimes preimage space and image space. The
input space for the private-&gt;public key "function" in Bitcoin is of
course the set of all integers modulo \(N\). And then output space is
the set of all public keys, which is the set of all points on the curve
secp256k1. Here we have what's called a "one-one" mapping (technically
it's both "one-one" and also "onto", since all points in the output
space are mapped to). But only "nice" functions are like that, not all
are. Some, in particular, have <strong>more than one input corresponding to
the same output</strong>.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what's happening with the Pedersen commitment;
moreover, there's a very concrete reason <em>why</em> the Pedersen commitment
has that property of having multiple inputs for the same output - it
logically has to! Consider this diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200428225915im_/https://joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/InputOutput1.png/InputOutput1-689x487.png" width="689" height="487" alt="Input space larger than output space" /></p>
<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">pigeonhole
principle</a>,
because there are more inputs than outputs, it's impossible for it <em>not</em>
to be the case that at least some outputs have more than one
corresponding input - they wouldn't all "fit" otherwise. And it's for
this reason that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a commitment
scheme where the input space is larger than the output space can have
perfect hiding.</span> (notice "can", not "will" - for the hiding to be
*perfect* we need to be leaking zero information about which element
of the input space is being hidden; that needs it to be the case that we
can demonstrate that *any* element of some very large subset of the
input space is part of a valid opening of a given commitment \(C\);
that's true here in Pedersen, but certainly not for some other
commitment schemes).</p>
<p>And for the exact same reason, the binding is only computational - there
are bound to be at least some outputs with more than one input, and so
if nothing else, by exhaustive search, the computationally unbounded
attacker can simply search and find the other input corresponding to the
same output (as per the diagram, if the attacker had the value \(k\)
as commitment, he could find \(x_2, r_2\) even if the commitment was
originally to \(x_1, r_1\). At least that'll be true for <em>some</em>
outputs (in Pedersen, for every output, in fact).</p>
<p>So the Pedersen commitment falls neatly into this category; it has an
input space of 512 bits if the message \(x\) and randomness \(r\)
are both the same size as the group elements and an output space of 256
bits (almost exactly); the outputs \(C\) are the points on the
secp256k1 curve.</p>
<p>(You'll notice how technically "exhaustive search" may not be the actual
process - there can be shortcuts depending on how the commitment is
structured; in the case of Pedersen, because it hinges on the unknown
discrete log \(\gamma\), the attacker can leverage that - he can use
that knowledge to find these "other inputs" directly instead of by
exhaustive search).</p>
<p>What if the input space is <em>smaller</em> than the output space? It takes a
moment of reflection to realise that this idea doesn't make sense. A
function has a single output by definition (note that doesn't mean the
output can't be multiple "things", e.g. it could be 4 integers or 6
curve points or 5 triangles, whatever - but each of them is a single
output). So a function with 10 inputs can't have more than 10 outputs.
Which means we have one case remaining:</p>
<p>What if the input space is <em>the same size as </em>the output space?</p>
<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200428225915im_/https://joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/InputOutput2.png/InputOutput2-688x487.png" width="688" height="487" alt="Input and output space equal size" /></p>
<p>In this case we must have a one-one mapping - again by the pigeonhole
principle (Remember, we are defining the output space as the space of
actual possible outputs, not some larger set; this will usually require
justification - you can justify it here by first considering the second
commitment point \(C_2=rG\) - note that the lines are horizontal for
a reason!). And by the same reasoning as above, but in reverse, we see
that this gives <strong>perfect</strong> binding, and <strong>at best
computational (imperfect) hiding.</strong></p>
<p>What's neat about this reasoning is that none of it is specific to
anything elliptic curve, or discrete log related, or anything - it
applies to <em>any</em> commitment scheme, including the hash-based one we
introduced right at the start. The only difference between the Pedersen
and hash-based case is because of the messiness mathematically of hash
functions, we can't really talk about perfection; it's only the
limitations, the negative parts of the above logic, that are the same:</p>
<p>If your output space is the space of SHA256 outputs, then it's 256 bits.
Now according to specification, that hash function can take extremely
large input (I forget exactly, but vastly larger than 256 bits), which
means it is in the first category - its input space is vastly larger
than its output space, so it <strong>cannot</strong> be perfectly binding. But that
<em>doesn't</em> mean that it's perfectly hiding, unfortunately - that would
require that a given output leaks precisely zero information about the
corresponding input. But it's certainly not the case that we have some
theorem about SHA256 that ensures that every input is equiprobable,
given an arbitrary output. So at <em>best</em> we have computational hiding,
and that's based on the idea tha the hash function is well designed. See
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">Wikipedia</a>
for a reminder on the key properties of cryptographic hash functions.
These properties are also what provides the argument for at least a
computational binding. But again, it's certainly not perfectly either
hiding <em>or</em> binding.</p>
<p>So let's summarize the key insight:</p>
<p><strong>It's LOGICALLY impossible for a commitment scheme to be both perfectly
hiding and perfectly binding, no matter what algorithm or mathematical
architecture is used to construct it.</strong></p>
<p>Why "logically"? Because we've demonstrated the two ideas are
fundamental contradictions of each other; it is only confusion to think
you can get both at the same time. Another way to say it (slightly more
dynamic description):</p>
<p><strong>A commitment scheme which has been constructed to have perfect binding
will at BEST achieve computational hiding, while a scheme constructed to
achieve perfect hiding will at BEST achieve computational binding.</strong></p>
<p>Here we're emphasizing that these are the limits, only achieved by well
designed algorithms; a badly designed or not-fit-for-purpose commitment
scheme may not be perfect in <em>either</em> sense, and for example may not
even manage to be computationally hiding, e.g. an adversary may very
feasibly be able to break the hiding property without excessive
computational resources. This is just a description of the <em>best</em> we can
do.</p>
<h2>From hidden to bound</h2>
<p>We'll get into the Bitcoin-related application shortly, but for now note
that is not unreasonable to prefer binding over hiding in the trade-off.
Since clearly Pedersen doesn't fit there, what does?</p>
<p>Let's start with an almost-obvious idea: suppose I want to commit to a
value \(x\) and have it be perfectly binding. Can I just use
\(C=xG\) as the commitment?</p>
<p>If you've been following along, you'll probably be a little uncertain,
because .. the "hiding" part doesn't seem to have been implemented.
You're right to be uncertain, because the answer is really "formally no,
but it kinda depends".</p>
<p>There are two scenarios: if the set of values you might commit to is
restricted in some way, e.g. a number between 1 and \(2^{25}\) then
the lack of hiding makes the commitment a complete failure, because a
computer could just find it by brute force guessing. And if your \(x\)
was a random value in the entire range \(2^{256}\) of elements of the
group - this kind of construction <em>is</em> sometimes used as a commitment,
but it doesn't count as a proper, generic commitment <em>scheme</em>, because
it doesn't have even computational hiding in the general case; if I
<em>think</em> I know what your \(x\) is (or know the range of it), I can
just check if I'm right; there is no blinding value \(r\) to prevent
that.</p>
<p>This naturally leads us to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption">ElGamal encryption
scheme</a>,
re-purposed as a commitment scheme (this can be done with any
cryptosystem, by the way):</p>
<p>Take our usual suspects \((x, r)\) and construct <strong>two</strong> elliptic
curve points: \((xG+rH, rG)\). This is the ElGamal commitment (with
all notation as for Pedersen). Wait, I hear you cry - you're just
regurgitating the Pedersen commitment, but adding \(rG\)? What does
that mean? Well, we're taking the slightly broken idea above and
applying it <em>in conjunction with</em> the idea of the Pedersen commitment.
We "commit" to the value \(r\) using \(rG\), and that's OK
specifically because \(r\) is a random number in the range (a bit like
a "nonce") used just for this commitment, so there is no guessing it
outside the standard brute force or breaking ECDLP; by doing so we've
increased the <strong>output space</strong> from Pedersen's set of single curve
points to the Cartesian product of 2 sets of curve points. And we by
doing so arrive at the second of the two scenarios described in the two
diagrams above; now, for each input tuple \((x, r)\), there is an
output tuple \((C_1,C_2) = (xG+rH,rG)\) - guaranteed distinct
because the mapping from \(r\) to \(rG\) is one-one - so the mapping
is one-one and is perfectly binding. More simply: the task of the
adversary who wants to break the commmitment by opening it to a
different value than originally chosen is now impossible: for \(rG\)
there is precisely one and only one \(r\), and once \(r\) is set,
there is only one \(x\): it's the discrete log of \(C_1 -rH\) which
is now uniquely defined, once \(r\) is.</p>
<p>And, following our insights above, it is now decidely unsurprising to
learn that the described ElGamal commitment is only computationally
hiding: because \(rG\) is published as a separate curve point
\(C_2\) and not folded into the single curve point as with Pedersen,
an attacker with the ability to solve the discrete log problem can
extract, from that, \(r\) and then follow up by extracting from
\(C_1 - rH=xG\), the supposedly hidden committed value \(x\).</p>
<p>But let's be clear: it <em>is</em> computationally hiding, unlike our toy
"quasi-commitment" \(xG\) which fails at that task (imagine committing
to the value "2"). And that can be expressed formally with what's called
a "reduction proof"; a rather weird but also very clever concept often
used in cryptography:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">The ElGamal commitment is hiding if the DDH problem is hard,</span>
<span class="err">because an adversary who can violate the hiding property of the ElGamal</span>
<span class="err">commitment can use that algorithm to solve the DDH problem.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>DDH refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decisional_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_assumption">Decisional Diffie Hellman
problem</a>
- in words, it's that you can't distinguish  \(abG\) from a random
curve point, even if you already know the values of \(A,B\) where
\(A=aG, B=bG\).</p>
<p>The intended consequence of this reasoning (and notice how slippery this
logic is!) is to say: DDH is <em>actually</em> hard, therefore ElGamal is
computationally hiding. Or: since it <em>is</em> believed that DDH is hard, it
follows that "we" (some undefined group of cryptographers) believe that
ElGamal, as a commitment scheme, is computationally hiding.</p>
<h3>Brief observation: ElGamal is homomorphic</h3>
<p>Notice how the description of the homomorphic (with respect to addition)
property of the Pedersen commitment cross applies here; even though we
have two curve points here, not one, the same linearity exists:</p>
<p>\(C_{EG}(x_1, r_1) + C_{EG}(x_2, r_2) = \)</p>
<p>\((x_1G + r_1H, r_1G) + (x_2G + r_2H, r_2G)\)</p>
<p>\( = ((x_1 + x_2)G + (r_1+r_2)H, (r_1+r_2)G)\)</p>
<p>\( = C_{EG}(x_1+x_2, r_1+r_2)\)</p>
<h2>An unpalatable tradeoff?</h2>
<p>So all of the above is the "behind the scenes" of the discussion you'll
often see in public about <a href="https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions/investigation">Confidential
Transactions</a>
in Bitcoin, specifically (not that the tradeoff doesn't apply in other
systems like Monero of course).</p>
<p>We naturally choose the Pedersen commitment for Confidential
Transactions, because it's more compact (remember - size of output
space!). It's only one curve point as output. Confidential Transactions
take up a non-trivial amount of extra space in a transaction, so it's
natural to prefer Pedersen to ElGamal for that reason, even though,
importantly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both have the
necessary homomorphic property</span> as already outlined.</p>
<p>Moreover (and more importantly, actually), a CT output needs a <em>range
proof</em> (as explained in great detail e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/ConfidentialTransactionsDoc/">here</a>,
see also bulletproofs e.g.
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf">here</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/from0k2bp">here</a>),
which itself requires a <em>lot</em> of space - the range proofs described in
the link, especially bulletproofs, go to a lot of trouble to condense
this data to the greatest extent possible, since it must be published on
the blockchain for all to verify, but that space usage is a serious
issue.</p>
<p>The previous links point to all the work done on space optimisation for
Pedersen; if we switched to ElGamal we'd lose that (I'm not exactly sure
<em>where</em> we'd be in terms of how much space a CT style output would take
up, but it would definitely be considerably more. While writing this
I've noticed Andreev has written up an ElGamal range proof
<a href="https://blog.chain.com/preparing-for-a-quantum-future-45535b316314">here</a>).</p>
<p>Hence the title of the subsection; our choice in CT for something like
Bitcoin seems to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue on the existing path - highly space optimised Pedersen
    commitments with perfect hiding and computational binding under the
    ECDLP assumption.</li>
<li>Switch to ElGamal commitments, with much more bloaty range proofs
    and commitments, which however have perfect binding and
    computational hiding (under DDH assumption).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people might argue that there is just too much fuss and worry about
this. Computational is good enough, if our crypto hardness assumptions
are good enough, and they are kind of industry standard already. However
there's a big problem with this reasoning, and it was explained in the
"tradeoffs" section of
<a href="https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-steganographic-principle">this</a>
earlier blog post. To avoid getting sidetracked on that now, let me
summarize simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A break in the binding assumption of Confidential Transactions can
result in the attacker being able to print money in arbitrary amounts
at any time, with absolutely no knowledge by the outside world.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I was at pains to point out in the linked blog post, this problem is
not CT-specific; it's generic to any blinding mechanism relying on
cryptographic hardness assumptions (i.e. without <strong>perfect binding</strong> or
something analogous where even an infinitely powerful adversary cannot
violate the binding of the blinded amount).</p>
<p>But here (for the rest of this blog post) we'll focus specifically on
the CT version of the problem.</p>
<h2>The unexcluded middle</h2>
<p>If perfect binding and hiding are logically incompatible in a
commitment, our only choice to violate the principle of the excluded
middle is to step outside the boundaries of the problem described, and
the most natural way to do that is to use two different commitments.</p>
<p>Using both Pedersen and ElGamal concurrently makes so little sense as to
be incoherent, not least because an ElGamal commitment <em>contains</em> a
Pedersen commitment. But the key word you could have skipped over in
that sentence was <strong>concurrently</strong>. Ruffing and Malavolta in <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/237.pdf">this
paper</a>
suggest spreading the problem over time:</p>
<h2>Switch commitments</h2>
<p>The idea here is deceptively simple: what if you use an ElGamal
commitment, but don't verify the non-Pedersen component (the second
point \(rG\) to use consistent notation) initially. If there is some
time \(T\) at which all participants in the system agree that the
ECDLP has "fallen" to quantum computing (the most well discussed failure
vector of elliptic curve crypto), it could be required that after that
flag day, spending of coins (presumably into some safer new cryptosystem
defined by consensus; spending into current-style Bitcoin outputs would
probably not make sense, here) is only valid if the verification/opening
(and the range proof) were applied to the full ElGamal commitment
\(xG+rH, rG\) and not just \(xG+rH\) as was allowed before \(T\).</p>
<p>There are two critiques that may immediately spring to mind, one obvious
and one not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily a realistic scenario - the break may be very public
    or not, it may be very gradual or not. Declaring a flag day is
    mostly assuming it being public. So it's not a panacea.</li>
<li>If you've been reading closely all this time, you'll be alert to a
    serious drawback: publishing an ElGamal commitment will not actually
    be hiding, if ECDLP is "cracked" (you remember that it requires DDH
    hardness, but it's easy to see that if you "crack" ECDLP you also
    crack DDH).</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a more positive perspective, though: it's not as if \(T\) has
to be a "panic stations day". Just as hash functions and TLS versions
are sometimes retired because they <em>start</em> to show just a <em>tiny</em> bit of
weakness, it would similarly make perfect sense for Bitcoin to be
similarly prompt in making a switch to a post-quantum cryptosystem once
EC came into question, and not wait to be attacked. Not to say it would
be easy!</p>
<p>This approach is sometimes called "cryptographic agility" - awkward as
it seems, we do kinda want the ability to upgrade cryptographic
protocols "in-flight", while they are being used.</p>
<p>So at this point we have an ingenious and smart <em>amelioration</em> to the
problem, but it can't be called a complete solution, I think - and
principally because of the (admittedly tiny) possibility of a private
break by some lone genius or similar.</p>
<h3>We put a commitment inside your commitment, so ...</h3>
<p>The authors and collaborators of the switch commitment paper and idea
(Ruffing, Malavolta, Wuille, Poelstra, others .. I'm not actually sure)
found a way to slightly improve the properties of such switch
commitments: a structure they call the <strong>opt-in switch commitment</strong>
which looks something like this:</p>
<p>\(xG + (r+\mathbb{H}(xG+rH || rG))H = xG + r'H\)</p>
<p>The idea is to tweak the blinding component of a standard Pedersen
commitment with the hash of an ElGamal commitment to the same value
(insert old meme as appropriate). Those of you aware of such things may
instantly recognize a close parallel with ideas like pay-to-contract and
<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/taproot-coming-what-it-and-how-it-will-benefit-bitcoin/">taproot</a>
(the latter was inspired by the former, so no surprise there). We're
effectively committing to a "contract" which here is a promise to open
to an ElGamal commitment <em>later,</em> if the consensus calls for it, while
for now not revealing that contract, as it's hidden/blinded with the
value \(r\).</p>
<p>As noted <a href="https://lists.launchpad.net/mimblewimble/msg00479.html">on the mimblewimble mailing
list</a>
by Ruffing, this has a couple of very important advantages over the
non-opt-in version:</p>
<ul>
<li>It preserves the perfect hiding of the Pedersen commitment for as
    long as the flag day \(T\) isn't reached (it's exactly a Pedersen
    commitment until then).</li>
<li>It doesn't use up another curve point on the blockchain - you only
    publish the single curve point as per Pedersen, and not two as per
    ElGamal.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Another useful feature - you can derive the value of \(r\) from your
private key deterministically to make it more practical).</p>
<p>Of course one must prove it's secure (under the random oracle model) but
for now I'll take that as a given (it's too much detail for here). But
clearly this is a neat way to encapsulate that "switch" idea; modulo
security proofs, it's an unqualified and very substantial improvement
over the "naked ElGamal" version.</p>
<h3>A hard decision for the sleepy or lazy</h3>
<p>There is still an area of imperfection even in this souped-up "opt-in"
switch commitment case. After the flag day \(T\) if you still have not
moved coins from existing outputs, you can publish the ElGamal
"contract" (commitment) inside the hash, thus keeping the binding
property, so that the envisioned attacker-possessing-a-quantum-computer
will still not be able to print money, but in so doing, you give up the
hiding (the value is revealed <em>at least to such attackers</em> because they
can break the DDH problem). So thus a person failing to take action
before said deadline \(T\) has at least to risk, and probably lose,
one of those two: their privacy of amount or their money.</p>
<h2>Have your cake and eat it?</h2>
<p>Is it possible to do better than such a transition approach, as
envisaged in the switch commitments paradigm?</p>
<p>As was earlier discussed, it suffers from not covering every threat
scenario, in particular, it does not cover the scenario of a private and
unexpected break.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is where this very long blog post trails off ...
because I don't know, and currently I don't think anyone else does.</p>
<p>My personal feeling was that the switch commitment paradigm suggests
there might be a way to finesse this tradeoff about using commitments.
And it also seems to be something which Adam Back seems to have gone
some way to thinking through - the fact that a single commitment scheme
can't provide perfect hiding and binding for a single value doesn't
imply that it is impossible to get this property, <strong>as long you're not
working with the same value</strong>. For example, what if you could provide an
ElGamal commitment for the money created in a Bitcoin <em>block</em>, while
providing Pedersen commitments as in the current design of CT for the
individual transactions? This means that a quantum or ECDLP breaking
attacker can "snoop" into the overall value created in a block, but this
should either be already known or uninteresting, while although he could
in theory violate the binding property of individual transactions, this
would in turn violate the binding of the block-level commitment which is
supposed to be impossible?</p>
<p>I suspect my original line of thinking is somehow incoherent (how,
mathematically, are the block-level and transaction-level commitments
related?), but Dr Back seems to have in mind something involving
coinjoin-like interactivity. I am leaving it here without attempting to
describe further, because the question seems to continue to be
interesting and if there <em>is</em> a solution (even perhaps if it involves
interactivity), it would be a hugely important fact, making CT a much
more plausible technology for a global money.</p>
<h3>Build the wall?</h3>
<p>We could also take the Trumpian approach - it's far from infeasible to
imagine that there is a mechanism that prevents CT coins arriving back
into plaintext area without allowing any hidden inflation that <em>might</em>
occur to "infect". This is essentially the sidechain model, except it
could be implemented in a variety of different ways. In fact, this
<strong>model already does exist</strong> in the sidechain
<a href="https://blockstream.com/liquid/">Liquid</a>,
which uses CT. But there have also been proposals to implement CT as a
kind of extension block (which has slightly different tradeoffs to a
sidechain), for example see ZmnSCPxj's note
