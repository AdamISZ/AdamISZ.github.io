<h2>SNICKER - Simple Non-Interactive Coinjoin with Keys for Encryption Reused</h2>
<p>I'm going to do this backwards - start with the end goal user
experience, and then work backwards to the technical design. This way,
those not wanting to get lost in technical details can still get the
gist.</p>
<h3><img alt="Me misusing a meme as a symbol and not adding any text." height="330" src="../../../../../../20200510162733im_/https:/joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/evilplanbaby.jpg/evilplanbaby-400x330.jpg" width="400"></h3>
<p><em>Pictured above: me misusing a meme as a symbol and deliberately not
adding any text to it.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Scenario</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Alisa</strong> lives in Moscow; she is a tech-savvy Bitcoin user, uses Linux
and the command line, and runs a fully verifying Bitcoin Core node. She
doesn't have indexing enabled, but she (sometimes, or long-running)
runs a tool called <code>snicker-scan</code> on the blocks received by her node. It
scans recent Bitcoin blocks looking for transactions with a particular
pattern, and returns to her in a file a list of candidate transactions.
She pipes this list into another tool which uses her own Bitcoin wallet
and constructs proposals: new transactions involving her own utxos and
utxos from these newly found transactions, which she signs herself.
Then, for each one, she makes up a secret random number and sends (the
proposed transactions + the secrets), encrypted to a certain public key,
in each case, so no one but the owner can read it, to a Tor hidden
service which accepts such submissions. For now, her job is done and she
gets on with her day.</p>
<p><strong>Bob</strong> lives in New York. He's a Bitcoin enthusiast who uses it a lot,
and likes to test out new features, but has never written code and
isn't tech-savvy like that. A few hours after Alisa went to bed he
opens one of his mobile wallets and a message pops up:
<code>New coinjoin proposals found. Check?</code>. He heard about this, and heard
that you can improve your privacy with this option, and even sometimes
gain a few satoshis in the process. So he clicks <code>Yes</code>. In the
background his mobile wallet downloads a file of some 5-10MB (more on
this later!). Bob did this once before and was curious about the file;
when he opened it he saw it was text with lots of unintelligible
encrypted stuff like this:</p>
<p><code>QklFMQOVXvpqgjaJFm00QhuJ1iWsnYYV4yJLjE0LaXa8N8c34Hzg5CeQduV.....</code>\
<code>QklFMQI2JR50dOGEQdDdmeX0BwMH4c+yEW1v5/IyT900WBGdYRA/T5mqBMc.....</code></p>
<p>Now his mobile does some processing on this file; it takes a little
while, some seconds perhaps, processing in the background. At the end it
pops up a new message:
<code>Coinjoin transaction found. Would you like to broadcast it?</code> and
underneath it shows the transaction spending 0.2433 BTC out of his
wallet and returning 0.2434 BTC in one of the outputs. It shows that the
other inputs and outputs are not his, although one of them is also for
0.2434 BTC. Does he want to accept? Sure! Free money even if it's only
cents. Even with no free money, he knows that coinjoin makes his privacy
better. So he clicks <code>Yes</code> and it's broadcast. Done.</p>
<h3>The NIC in SNICKER</h3>
<p>Non-interactivity is a hugely desirable property in protocols; this is
particularly the case where privacy is a priority. Firstly, it avoids
the need to synchronize (<strong>Alisa</strong>, and her computer, had gone to sleep
when <strong>Bob</strong> performed his step). Second, to avoid malicious
interruption of an interactive protocol, it can help to identify the
participants, but that is very damaging to the whole point of a protocol
whose goal is privacy. Non-interactivity cuts this particular Gordian
knot; one side can send the message anonymously and the other
participant simply uses the data, but this has the limitation of the
sender finding the receiver, which means some weak identification of the
latter. Even better is if the request can be sent encrypted to the
receiver, then it can be broadcast anywhere for the receiver to notice.
That latter model is the most powerful, and is used here, but it does
have practicality drawbacks as we'll discuss.</p>
<p>So, note that in the above scenario <strong>Alisa</strong> and <strong>Bob</strong> do not meet,
do not synchronize, and need never meet or find out who each other are
in future either. Their "meeting" is entirely abstracted out to one
side publishing an encrypted message and the other side receiving <em>all</em>
such encrypted messages and only reading the one(s) encrypted to his
pubkey. The <em>all</em> part helps preserve Bob's privacy, if he finds a way
to broadcast the final transaction with a reasonable anonymity defence
(see e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/gfanti/bips/blob/master/bip-dandelion.mediawiki">Dandelion</a>;
I'm of the opinion that that battle - making Bitcoin transaction
broadcast anonymous - is something we <em>will</em> win, there is a massive
asymmetry in favour of the privacy defender there).</p>
<h3>Quick background - how to do a Coinjoin</h3>
<p>Here's the obligatory
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0">link</a>
to the Coinjoin OP. You can skip this section if you know Coinjoin well.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'll give you a quick intro here, one that naturally leads
into the SNICKER concept:</p>
<p>Each input to a transaction requires (for the transaction to be valid) a
signature by the owner of the private key (using singular deliberately,
restricting consideration to p2pkh or segwit equivalent here) over a
message which is \~ the transaction. Each of these signatures can be
constructed separately, by separate parties if indeed the private key
for each input are owned by separate parties. The "normal" coinjoining
process thus involves the following steps (for now, not specifying <em>who</em>
carries out each step):</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all of the inputs - the utxos that will be spent</li>
<li>Gather all of the destination addresses to various parties, and the
    amounts to be paid</li>
<li>Distribute a "template" of the transaction to all parties (i.e.
    the transaction without any signatures)</li>
<li>In some order all of the parties sign the transaction; whomever has
    a transaction with all signatures complete, can broadcast it to the
    Bitcoin network</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different protocols one can choose to get all these steps
done, ranging from simple to complex. A server can be the coordinating
party; blinding can be used to prevent the server knowing input-output
mapping.
<a href="http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/">Coinshuffle</a>
can be used, creating a kind of onion-routing approach to prevent
parties involved knowing the linkages (doesn't require a server to
coordinate, but requires more complex interactivity). One of the parties
in the join can be the "server", thus that party gains privacy that
the others don't (Joinmarket). Etc.</p>
<p>The difficulties created by any interactivity are considerably
ameliorated in a client-server model (see e.g. the old blockchain.info
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Shared_coin">SharedCoin</a>(link
outdated) model), the serious tradeoff is the server knowing too much,
and/or a coordination/waiting problem (which may be considered
tolerable; see both SharedCoin and
<a href="https://github.com/darkwallet/darkwallet">DarkWallet</a>;
with a sufficient liquidity pool the waiting may be acceptable).</p>
<p>There are a lot of details to discuss here, but there is always <em>some</em>
interactivity (you can only sign once you know the full transaction,
assuming no custom sighashing^1^), and a model with a server is
basically always going to be more problematic, especially at scale.</p>
<p>So hence we try to construct a way of doing at least simple Coinjoins,
in at least some scenarios, without any server requirement or
coordination. Now I'll present the basic technical concept of how to do
this in SNICKER, in 2 versions.</p>
<h3>First version - snicKER = Keys for Encryption Reused</h3>
<p>To make the Coinjoin non-interactive, we need it to be the case that
Alisa can post a message for Bob, without explicitly requesting to
create a private message channel with him. This requires encrypting a
message that can then be broadcast (e.g. over a p2p network or on a
bulletin board).</p>
<p><em>(In case it isn't clear that either encryption or a private message
channel is required, consider that Alice must pass to Bob a secret which
identifies Bob's output address (explained below), critically, and also
her signature, which is on only her inputs; if these are seen in public,
the input-output linkages are obvious to anyone watching, defeating the
usual purpose of Coinjoin.)</em></p>
<h5>Encryption</h5>
<p>To achieve this we need a public key to encrypt a message to Bob. This
is the same kind of idea as is used in tools like PGP/gpg - only the
owner of the public key's private key can read the message.</p>
<p>In this "First version" we will assume something naughty on Bob's
part: that he has <strong>reused an address</strong>! Thus, a public key will exist
on the blockchain which we assume (not guaranteed but likely; nothing
dangerous if he doesn't) he still holds the private key for.</p>
<p>Given this admittedly unfortunate assumption, we can use a simple and
established encryption protocol such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Encryption_Scheme">ECIES</a>
to encrypt a message to the holder of that public key.</p>
<p>Alisa, upon finding such a pubkey, call it <code>PB</code>, and noting the
corresponding utxo <code>UB</code>, will need to send, ECIES encrypted to <code>PB</code>,
several items (mostly wrapped up in a transaction) to Bob to give him
enough material to construct a valid coinjoin without any interaction
with herself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her own utxos (just <code>UA</code> for simplicity)</li>
<li>Her proposed destination address(s)</li>
<li>Her proposed amounts for output</li>
<li>Her proposed bitcoin transaction fee</li>
<li>The full proposed transaction template using <code>UA</code> and <code>UB</code> as inputs
    (the above 4 can be implied from this)</li>
<li>Her own signature on the transaction using the key for <code>UA</code></li>
<li>Her proposed destination address <strong>for Bob</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Destination</h4>
<p>The last point in the above list is of course at first glance not
possible, unless you made some ultra dubious assumptions about shared
ownership, i.e. if Alisa somehow tried to deduce other addresses that
Bob already owns (involving <em>more</em> address reuse). I don't dismiss this
approach <em>completely</em> but it certainly looks like a bit of an ugly mess
to build a system based on that. Instead, we can use a very well known
construct in ECC; in English something like "you can tweak a
counterparty's pubkey by adding a point that <em>you</em> know the private key
for, but you still won't know the private key of the sum". Thus in
this case, Alice, given Bob's existing pubkey <code>PB</code>, which is the one
she is using to encrypt the message, can construct a new pubkey:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">PB2 = PB + k*G</span>
</pre></div>


<p>for some 32 byte random value <code>k</code>.</p>
<p>Alice will include the value of <code>k</code> in the encrypted message, so Bob can
verify that the newly proposed destination is under his control (again
we'll just assume a standard p2pkh address based on <code>PB2</code>, or a segwit
equivalent).</p>
<p>Assuming Bob somehow finds this message and successfully ECIES-decrypts
it using the private key of <code>PB</code>, he now has everything he needs to (if
he chooses), sign and broadcast the coinjoin transaction.</p>
<h4>A protocol for the most naive version, in broad strokes:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Alisa must have the ability to scan the blockchain to some extent;
    she must find scriptSigs or witnesses containing pubkeys which were
    later reused in new addresses/scriptPubKeys.</li>
<li>Alisa will use some kind of filtering mechanism to decide which are
    interesting. The most obvious two examples are: amounts under
    control in Bob's utxos matching her desired range, and perhaps age
    of utxos (so likely level of activity of user) or some watermarking
    not yet considered.</li>
<li>Having found a set of potential candidates, for each case <code>PB, UB</code>:
    Construct a standard formatted message; here is a simple suggestion
    although in no way definitive:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>{=html}
&lt;!-- --&gt;</code>
        8(?) magic bytes and 2 version bytes for the message type
        k-value 32 bytes
        Partially signed transaction in standard Bitcoin serialization
        (optionally padding to some fixed length)</p>
<p>We defer discussing how in practice Bob will get access to the message
later; but note that if he has done this, he already knows the value of
<code>P_B</code> and will thus know also <code>U_B</code>. He ECIES-decrypts it, and
recognizes it's for him through correct magic bytes (other messages
encrypted to other pubkeys will come out random).</p>
<p>Then, this format has sufficient information for Bob to evaluate easily.
First, he can verify that <code>U_B</code> is in the inputs. Then he can verify
that for 1 of the 2 outputs (simple model) has a scriptPubKey
corresponding to <code>PB2 = PB + k*G</code>. He can then verify the output amounts
fit his requirements. Finally he can verify the ECDSA signature provided
on <code>U_A</code> (hence "partially signed transaction"). Given this he can, if
he chooses, sign on <code>UB</code> using <code>PB</code> and broadcast. He must of course
keep a permanent record of either <code>k</code> itself or, more likely, the
private key <code>k + x</code> (assuming <code>P = x * G</code>).</p>
<h3>A proof-of-concept</h3>
<p>Before going further into details, and discussing the second (probably
superior but not as obviously workable) version of SNICKER, I want to
mention that I very quickly put together some proof of concept code in
<a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/SNICKER-POC">this github
repo</a>;
it uses
<a href="https://github.com/Joinmarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver">Joinmarket-clientserver</a>
as a dependency, implements ECIES in a compatible form to that used by
<a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>,
and allows testing on regtest or testnet, admittedly with a bunch of
manual steps, using the python script <code>snicker-tool.py</code>. The workflow
for testing is in the README. To extend the testing to more wallets
requires some way to do ECIES as well as some way to construct the
destination addresses as per <code>PB2 = PB + kG</code> above. I did note that,
usefully, the partially signed transactions can be signed directly in
Bitcoin Core using <code>signrawtransaction</code> and then <code>sendrawtransaction</code>
for broadcast, but note that somehow you'll have to recover the
destination address, as receiver, too. Note that there was no attempt at
all to construct a scanning tool for any reused-key transactions here,
and I don't intend to do that (at least, in that codebase).</p>
<h2>Practical issues</h2>
<p>In this section will be a set of small subsections describing various
issues that will have to be addressed to make this work.</p>
<h3>Wallet integration</h3>
<p>One reason this model is interesting is because it's much more
plausible to integrate into an existing wallet than something like
Joinmarket - which requires dealing with long term interactivity with
other participants, communicating on a custom messaging channel,
handling protocol negotiation failures etc. To do SNICKER as a receiver,
a wallet needs the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>ECIES - this is really simple if you have the underlying secp256k1
    and HMAC dependencies; see
    <a href="https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/lib/bitcoin.py#L774-L817">here</a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/SNICKER-POC/blob/master/ecies/ecies.py#L10-L50">here</a>;
    note that the root construction in ECIES is ECDH.</li>
<li>The ability to calculate <strong>and store</strong> the newly derived keys of the
    form <code>P' = P + kG</code> where <code>k</code> is what is passed to you, and <code>P</code> is
    the pubkey of your existing key controlling the output to be spent.
    I would presume that you would have to treat <code>k+x</code>, where <code>P=xG</code>, as
    a newly imported private key. Note that we <em>cannot</em> use a
    deterministic scheme for this from <code>P</code>, since that would be
    calculatable by an external observer; it must be based on a secret
    generated by "Alisa".This could be a bit annoying for a wallet,
    although of course it's easy in a naive sense.</li>
<li>Ability to parse files containing encrypted coinjoin proposals in
    the format outlined above - this is trivial.</li>
<li>Ability to finish the signing of a partially signed transaction.
    Most wallets have this out of the box (Core does for example); there
    might be a problem for a wallet if it tacitly assumes complete
    ownership of all inputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a wallet only wanted to implement the receiver side (what we called
"Bob" above), that's it.</p>
<h4>Compatibility/consensus between different wallets</h4>
<p>The only "consensus" part of the protocol is the format of the
encrypted coinjoin proposals (and the ECIES algorithm used to encrypt
them). We could deal with different transaction types being proposed
(i.e. different templates, e.g. 3 outputs or 4, segwit or not), although
obviously it'll be saner if there are a certain set of templates that
everyone knows is acceptable to others.</p>
<h3>Notes on scanning for candidates</h3>
<p>There is no real need for each individual "Alisa" to scan, although
she might wish to if she has a Bitcoin node with indexing enabled. This
is a job that can be done by any public block explorer and anyone can
retrieve the data, albeit there are privacy concerns just from you
choosing to download this data. The data could be replicated on Tor
hidden services for example for better privacy. So for now I'm assuming
that scanning, itself, is not an issue.</p>
<p>A much bigger issue might be finding <strong>plausible</strong> candidates. Even in
this version 1 model of looking only for reused keys, which are
hopefully not a huge subset of the total utxo set, there are tons of
potential candidates and, to start with, none of them at all are
plausible. How to filter them?</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter on amount - if Alisa has X coins to join, she'll want to
    work with outputs \&lt; X.</li>
<li>Filter on age - this is more debatable, but very old utxos are less
    likely to be candidates for usage.</li>
<li>An "active" filter - this is more likely to be how things work.
    Are certain transactions intrinsically watermarked in a way that
    indicates that the "Bob" in question is actually interested in
    this function? One way this can happen is if we know that the
    transaction is from a certain type of wallet, which already has this
    feature enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bootstrapping</h4>
<p>If a set of users were using a particular wallet or service (preferably
a <em>large</em> set), it might be possible to identify their transactions
"Acme wallet transactions". Funnily enough, Joinmarket, because it
uses a set and unusual coinjoin pattern, satisfies this property in a
very obvious way; but there might be other cases too. See the notes in
"second version", below, on how Joinmarket might work specifically in
that case.</p>
<p>Better of course, is if we achieved that goal with a more user-friendly
wallet with a much bigger user-base; I'd ask wallet developers to
consider how this might be achieved.</p>
<p>Another aspect of bootstrapping is the Joinmarket concept - i.e. make a
financial incentive to help bootstrap. If creators/proposers are
sufficiently motivated they may offer a small financial incentive to
"sweeten the pot", as was suggested in the scenario at the start of
this post. This will help a lot if you want the user-set to grow
reasonably large.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>This is of course filed under "problems you really want to have", but
it's nevertheless a very real problem, arguably the biggest one here.</p>
<p>Imagine 10,000 utxo candidates that are plausible and 1000 active
proposers. Imagine they could all make proposals for a large-ish subset
of the total candidates, we could easily imagine 1,000,000 candidates at
a particular time. Each encrypted record takes 500-800 bytes of space,
let's say. Just the data transfer starts to get huge - hundreds of
megabytes? Perhaps this is not as bad as it looks, <em>if</em> the data is
being received in small amounts over long periods.</p>
<p>And let's say we can find a way to get the data out to everybody - they
still have to try to decrypt <strong>every</strong> proposal with <strong>every</strong> pubkey
they have that is a valid candidate (in version 1, that's reused keys,
let's say, or some subset of them). The computational requirement of
that is huge, even if some cleverness could reduce it (decrypt only one
AES block; use high performance C code e.g. based on libsecp256k1).
Again, perhaps if this is happening slowly, streamed over time, or in
chunks at regular integrals, it's not as bad. Still.</p>
<p>It's true that these problems don't arise at small scale, but then the
real value of this would be if it scaled up to large anonymity sets.</p>
<p>Even if this is addressed, there is another problem arising out of the
anonymous submission - any repository of proposals could be filled with
junk, to waste everyone's time. Apart from a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">hashcash</a>-like
solution (not too implausible but may impose too much cost on the
proposer), I'm not sure how one could address that while keeping
submission anonymity.</p>
<p>At least we have the nice concept that this kind of protocol can improve
privacy on Bitcoin's blockchain without blowing up bandwidth and
computation for the Bitcoin network itself - it's "off-band", unlike
things like <a href="https://www.elementsproject.org/elements/confidential-transactions/investigation.html">Confidential
Transactions</a>
(although, of course, the effect of that is much more powerful). I think
ideas that take semantics and computation off chain are particularly
interesting.</p>
<h3>Conflicting proposals</h3>
<p>This is not really a problem: if Alisa proposes a coinjoin to Bob1 and
Bob2, and Bob1 accepts, then when Bob2 checks, he will find one of the
inputs for his proposed coinjoin is already spent, so it's not valid.
Especially in cases where there is a financial incentive, it just
incentives Bobs to be more proactive, or just be out of luck.</p>
<h3>Transaction structure and 2 party joins</h3>
<p>We have thus far talked only about 2 party coinjoins, which <em>ceteris
paribus</em> are an inferior privacy model compared to any larger number
(consider that in a 2 party coinjoin, the <em>other</em> party necessarily
knows which output is yours). The SNICKER model is not easily extendable
to N parties, although it's not impossible. But DarkWallet used 2 of 2
joins, and it's still in my opinion valuable. Costs are kept lower, and
over time these joins heavily damage blockchain analysis. A larger
number of joins, and larger anonymity set could greatly outweigh the
negatives<em>.</em></p>
<p>Structure: the model used in the aforementioned
<a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/SNICKER-POC">POC</a>,
although stupid simple, is still viable: 2 inputs, one from each party
(easily extendable to 1+N), 3 outputs, with the receiver getting back
exactly one output of \~ the same size as the one he started with. The
proposer then has 1 output of exactly that size (so 2 equal outputs) and
one change. Just as in Joinmarket, the concept is that fungibility is
gained specifically in the equal outputs (the "coinjoin outputs"); the
change output is of course trivially linked back to its originating
input(s).</p>
<p>But there's no need for us to be limited to just one transaction
structure; we could imagine many, perhaps some templates that various
wallets could choose to support; and it'll always be up to the receiver
to decide if he likes the structure or not. Even the stupid X->X, Y->Y
"coinjoin" I mused about in my Milan presentation
<a href="https://youtu.be/IKSSWUBqMCM?t=47m21s">here</a>(warning:youtube)
might be fun to do (for some reason!). What a particularly good or
"best" structure is, I'll leave open for others to discuss.</p>
<h3>Second version - snicKER = Keys Encrypted to R</h3>
<p>We've been discussing all kinds of weird and whacky "Non-Interactive
Coinjoin" models on IRC for years; and perhaps there will still be
other variants. But arubi was mentioning to me yesterday that he was
looking for a way to achieve this goal <em>without</em> the nasty requirement
of reused keys, and between us we figured out that it is a fairly
trivial extension, <em>if</em> you can find a way to get confidence that a
particular existing utxo is co-owned with an input (or any input).
That's because if you have an input, you have not only a pubkey, but
also a <strong>signature</strong> (both will either be stored in the scriptSig, or in
the case of segwit, in the witness section of the transaction). An
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a>
signature is published on the blockchain as a pair: <code>(r, s)</code>, where <code>r</code>
is the x-coordinate of a point <code>R</code> on the secp256k1 curve. Now, any
elliptic curve point can be treated as a pubkey, assuming someone knows
the private key for it; in the case of ECDSA, we call the private key
for <code>R</code>, <code>k</code>, that is: <code>R = kG</code>. <code>k</code> is called the nonce (="number used
once"), and is usually today calculated using the algorithm
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979">RFC6979</a>,
which determines its value deterministically from the private key
you're signing with, and the message. But what matters here is, the
signer either already knows <code>k</code>, or can calculate it trivially from the
signing key and the transaction. This provides us with exactly the same
scenario as in the first version; Bob knows the private key of <code>R</code>, so
Alisa can send a proposal encrypted to that public key, and can derive a
new address for Bob's destination using the same formula:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">PB2 = R + k&#39;G</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here I used <code>k'</code> to disambiguate from the signature nonce <code>k</code>, but it's
exactly the same as before. As before, Bob, in order to spend the output
from the coinjoin, will need to store the new private key <code>k+k'</code>. For a
wallet it's a bit more work because you'll have to keep a record of
past transaction <code>k</code> values, or perhaps keep the transactions and
retrieve <code>k</code> as and when. Apart from that, the whole protocol is
identical.</p>
<h4>Finding candidates in the second version</h4>
<p>In version 2, we no longer need Bob to do something dubious (reusing
addresses). But now the proposer (Alisa) has a different and arguably
harder problem than before; she has to find transactions where she has
some reasonable presumption that a specific output and a specific input
are co-owned. You could argue that this is good, because now Alisa is
proposing coinjoins where linkages <em>are</em> known, so she's improving
privacy exactly where it's needed :) (only half true, but amusing). In
a typical Bitcoin transaction there are two outputs - one to
destination, one change; if you can unambiguously identify the change,
even with say 90% likelihood not 100%, you could make proposals on this
basis. This vastly expands the set of <em>possible</em> candidates, if not
necessarily plausible ones (see above on bootstrapping).</p>
<p>Additionally paradoxical is the fact that Joinmarket transactions <em>do</em>
have that property! The change outputs are unambiguously linkable to
their corresponding inputs through subset-sum analysis, see e.g.
<a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/JMPrivacyAnalysis/blob/master/tumbler_privacy.md#jmsudoku-coinjoin-sudoku-for-jmtxs">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, Adlai Chandrasekhar's
<a href="http://adlai.uncommon-lisp.org:5000/">cjhunt</a>
tool (appears down as of writing),
<a href="https://github.com/adlai/cjhunt">code</a>,
identifies all very-likely-to-be Joinmarket transactions through
blockchain scanning, and its output could be used to generate candidates
(the proposed joins could be with those change outputs, using the `R`
values from one of the identified-as-co-owned inputs). See also
<a href="https://citp.github.io/BlockSci/chain/blockchain.html">BlockSci</a>.
Then if Joinmarket had both proposer- and receiver- side code
integrated, it would create a scenario where these type of coinjoins
would most likely be quite plausible to achieve.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think this idea might well be viable. It's simple enough that there
aren't likely crypto vulnerabilities. The short version of the pros and
cons:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>No interactivity (the point), has many positive consequences, and
    high anonymity standard</li>
<li>Relative ease of wallet integration (esp. compared to e.g.
    Joinmarket), consensus requirement between them is limited.</li>
<li>Potentially huge anonymity set (different for version 1 vs version
    2, but both very large)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>For now only 2 parties and probably stuck there; limited coinjoin
    model (although many transaction patterns possible).</li>
<li>Finding plausible candidates is hard, needs a bootstrap</li>
<li>Sybil attack on the encrypted messages; how to avoid the "junk
    mail" problem</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, it should be fine with Schnorr (to investigate: aggregation in
this model), in version 1 and version 2 forms.</p>
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p>1. Sighashing - attempting a non-interactive coinjoin with some
interesting use of <code>SIGHASH_SINGLE</code> and <code>SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY</code> seems at
least plausible (see
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/OP_CHECKSIG#Procedure_for_Hashtype_SIGHASH_SINGLE">here</a>),
although it's not exactly heartening that no one ever uses
<code>SIGHASH_SINGLE</code> (and its rules are arcane and restrictive), not to even
speak of watermarking. Hopefully the idea expressed here is better.</p></div>
