<h2>The multiparty symmetrical Schnorr signature scriptless script shuffle</h2>
<p>This blog is in the category of "a new-ish idea about privacy tech";
like similar previous ones (e.g.:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200429002041/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinjoinxt/">CoinJoinXT</a>)
it is little more than an idea, in this case I believe it is correct,
but (a) I could be wrong and there could be a flaw in the thinking and
(b) it's not entirely clear how practically realistic it will be. What I
do hope, however, is that the kernel of this idea is useful, perhaps in
Layer 2 tech or in something I haven't even thought about.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>As with similar writeups, I feel it's important that the reader has some
idea what the goal is. Here is the goal I <em>mostly</em> had in mind when
thinking this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 (or 6, or 24...) anonymous users coordinate (on a lobby server,
    with a Joinmarket-style incentive, on a p2p network somehow -
    whatever). They each have 1 BTC utxos (put off denomination
    questions for later) and they want a very meaningful privacy
    increase.</li>
<li>Instead of doing a CoinJoin which is obvious or a whole set of
    CoinSwaps (see
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200429002041/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/coinswaps/">earlier</a>
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200429002041/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">posts</a>)
    which could get complicated for 11 people, they want to kind of
    "permute" or "shuffle" all their utxos.</li>
<li>It's a year or two from now and a Schnorr soft fork has gone through
    in Bitcoin mainchain; they're going to use the scriptless script
    primitive (see
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200429002041/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">here</a>
    or Poelstra and Nick's writeup
    <a href="https://github.com/apoelstra/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md">here</a>,
    or the following sections for more on this), to achieve the goal via
    multisig outputs that look like other outputs.</li>
<li>They do effectively a "multiparty swap" or "shuffle" to achieve this
    goal. Each of the 11 participants funds a single prepared
    destination address, which is (though not seen because Schnorr) an
    11 of 11 multisig. Before they do so, they get hold of a presigned
    (by everyone) backout transaction to get their coins back if
    something goes wrong.</li>
<li>They decide a shuffle/permutation: e.g. Alice is paying Bob 1,
    Charlie is paying Edward etc etc. ... we're talking here about a
    member of the set of permutations of 11 objects. Obviously the idea
    is that everyone pays in 1, everyone gets back 1. They prepare
    transactions for these payments.</li>
<li>Once everything is set up they pass around <strong>adaptor signatures</strong>
    which create the atomicity effect we want - when any 1 of the 11
    transactions goes through, all of them will go through.</li>
<li>In a certain order, that we'll discuss, they can now pass real
    (Schnorr) signatures (note that even though "real" they are still
    "partial" signatures - they're 1 of 11 needed in the multisig) on
    the transactions such that one member of the group has a full set
    and can broadcast the transaction paying themselves. Everyone else
    sees this on the blockchain, and combining the signatures in this
    published transaction, with the earlier adaptor signatures, has
    enough information to broadcast the other transaction which pays
    themself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's consider the advantages of doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared with a 2 of 2 CoinSwap: there is no linkage on the blockchain
    between the 11 transactions. Effectively, Alice has swapped her coin
    history with Bob,  Charlie with Edward etc..</li>
<li>Big difference from the above: we can create, like a multiparty
    coinjoin, the highly desirable scenario that <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">individual participants do not
    know the linkages</span> between inputs for transactions other than
    their own. As we know, there are various designs of CoinJoin
    metaprotocols that allow this to different extents, but if CoinSwap
    is restricted to 2 of 2 this is impossible (no cryptographic
    trickery prevents the deduction "if it's not mine, it's yours!").</li>
<li>Biggest difference from CoinJoin is that CoinSwap transactions
    (whether 2-2 or 11-11) can look like ordinary payments on the
    blockchain, although there's meaningful wiggle room in how exactly
    they will look. If we manage to combine this with even slight
    variations in size of individual payments, and probably a little
    timing de-correlation too, the task of a blockchain analyst in
    identifying these is near impossible (<strong>notice that this hugely
    desirable steganographic feature is shared with PayJoin and
    CoinJoinXT, previous blog posts</strong> - notice though, that it depends
    on Schnorr for indistinguishable multisig <em>and</em> for adaptor
    signatures, unless ECDSA-n-party computation is a thing, which I
    doubt is currently a thing for more than 2 parties, but see e.g.
    <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/987.pdf">this</a>
    for recent research in this area.).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>A <strong>very</strong> simplified multiparty S6 as envisaged: note that Oscar to
Peter shows on a diagonal a simple transaction of the type used in
CoinSwap; in fact there is one such transaction for every red arrow;
i.e. each red arrow represents a payment from one of the group of 11 to
another, in a random permutation. All of these transactions will be
atomic; either they will all happen or none will. But none will be
linked on the blockchain.</em></p>
<h2>Schnorr and adaptor signatures</h2>
<p>Achieving the goals above is crucially dependent on the concept of an
adaptor signature as developed by Andrew Poelstra (see some detailed
descriptions as mentioned
<a href="https://github.com/apoelstra/scriptless-scripts/blob/master/md/atomic-swap.md">here</a>)
in his work on "scriptless scripts". A large part of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200429002041/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">earlier blog
post</a>
on the topic of the scriptless script based swap, was explaining this
concept. I want to write an explanation which is easier to understand. I
will try :)</p>
<p>A basic Schnorr signature on a message \(m\) using a public key
\(P\) whose private key is \(x\), looks like this:</p>
<p>\(\sigma = k + \mathbb{H}(P||R||m) x \quad, R = kG \quad
\textrm{Publish: }\ (R,\sigma)\)</p>
<p>\(k\) is called the nonce, and \(R\) is the nonce point (point on
the curve corresponding). We shorten the hash function
\(\mathbb{H}(\ldots)\) to just \(e\), often.</p>
<p>Schnorr signatures are linear in the keys, in that:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_1 + \sigma_2 = (k_1 + k_2) + e (x_1+x_2)\)</p>
<p><strong>Combining signatures in this way is unsafe in many contexts, in
particular multisignature in Bitcoin. See the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068">paper on
Musig</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ElementsProject/secp256k1-zkp/blob/secp256k1-zkp/src/modules/musig/musig.md">this
summary</a>
for the details on how the weakness (basically, potential of key
subtraction) is addressed in detail, using interactivity between the
parties cooperating to create the agreggated Schnorr signature. <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">As long as this is properly
addressed, though, the linearity property is retained</span>.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let me emphasise that the rest of this post will ignore the correct
construction of keys and nonce points for safe Schnorr multisig; we will
just talk about Alice, Bob and Charlie adding keys together and adding
signatures together; the difference is crucial in practice but I believe
does not alter any of the concepts being outlined.</strong></p>
<h3>Partial Signatures</h3>
<p>With the above bolded caveats in mind, it'll be important for the
following to understand the idea of a "partial signature" in a Schnorr
multisig context. What we're doing is to create a single signature
\(\sigma\) which represents, say, a 2 of 2 multisignature. Say it's
Alice and Bob (A, B). Then Alice would produce this <strong>partial
signature</strong>:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_A = k_A + \mathbb{H}(P_A + P_B || R_A + R_B || m)
x_A\)</p>
<p>Notice how it's not a valid signature according to the Schnorr
definition because the nonce \(k_A\) does not correspond to the nonce
point \(R_A + R_B\) <em>and</em> because the private key does not
correspond to the public key \(P_A+P_B\).</p>
<p>However when Bob adds his partial signature:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_B = k_B + \mathbb{H}(P_A + P_B || R_A + R_B || m)
x_B\)</p>
<p>... to Alice's, the sum of the two <em>is</em> a valid signature on the
message, with the sum of the keys.</p>
<p>We will make use of this shortly.</p>
<h3>Adaptor Signatures</h3>
<p>A creator of a signature can hide a verifiable secret value in a
signature, using simple addition. They can then pass across the
signature <em>without</em> the secret value, making it not valid, but
verifiable as "a signature with the secret not included". This is what
Poelstra means by his concept "adaptor signature". It looks like this:</p>
<p>\(\sigma' = k + \mathbb{H}(P||R+T||m) x \quad R=kG,\ T=tG \)</p>
<p>(from now on, note that ' indicates adaptor signatures). To repeat, it's
not a valid signature, but: <em>it can be verified that adding the discrete
log of \(T\)</em> *to \(\sigma'\) will yield a valid signature on the
message m and the public key \(P\)<strong><em>*.</em></strong></p>
<p>Refer back to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200429002041/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/flipping-the-scriptless-script-on-schnorr/">earlier blog
post</a>
if you want to check the mathematical details on that.</p>
<p>The alert reader will notice how similar the "adaptor signature" and
"partial signature" concepts are - it's almost the same mathematical
change, but with a very different purpose/application, as we expand on
below:</p>
<h3>Atomicity for two parties</h3>
<p>This trick is already cool - if I ever pass you the secret value
\(t\), you'll be able to form a full valid signature. But with an
additional nuance it's possible to make this a two-way promise, so we
have the outline of an atomicity property, which can be very powerful.
If the contents of the thing being signed, including the nonce points
\(R\) and the public keys \(P\) are fixed in advance, we could
create a situation where the promise works both ways:</p>
<p>\(P, R, m\) are known \(\therefore \sigma = k + t +
\mathbb{H}(P||R+T||m) x\) is fixed. If the adaptor is shared by
the owner of the private key \(x\), i.e. if he passes to a
counterparty the value \(\sigma' = k + \mathbb{H}(P||R+T||m)
x\), then either direction of publication reveals the other:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the full signature \(\sigma\) is revealed, the secret is
    revealed as \(t = \sigma - \sigma'\)</li>
<li>If the secret \(t\) is revealed, the full signature is revealed:
    \(\sigma = t + \sigma'\)</li>
</ul>
<p>This atomicity is the basic of the scriptless script atomic swap
published by Poelstra and explained in my earlier post.</p>
<h3>Atomicity for N parties</h3>
<p><strong>This is the novel idea in this post.</strong></p>
<p>Suppose we have fixed \(\Sigma P\), \(\Sigma R\) and a single
message \(m\). In other words several participants signing together
the same message (Bitcoin transaction).This is the scenario for Schnorr
aggregated multisig, modulo the complexity of Musig which as explained
above I'm deliberately ignoring. Without adaptors, each party will have
to produce a <strong>partial signature </strong> as already described, and then they
can all be added together to create a fully valid Schnorr signature.</p>
<p>Now suppose each of 3 parties (Alice, Bob, Charlie) makes an adaptor
signature for their partial signature:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_A' = k_A + \mathbb{H}(\Sigma P || \Sigma R + \Sigma T
|| m) x_A\)</p>
<p>Little explanatory note on this: each party will have to share their
public \(T\) values (which, remember are curve points corresponding to
the <em>adaptor secrets</em> \(t\)), so they will all know how to correctly
calculate the hash preimage by "combining" (here just adding, but with
musig it's more complicated) their public keys, and then linearly adding
in all their \(T\) public values to the corresponding \(R\) nonce
points as for a normal Schnorr signature.</p>
<p>Similarly for Bob, Charlie:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_B' = k_B + \mathbb{H}(\Sigma P || \Sigma R + \Sigma T
|| m) x_B\)</p>
<p>\(\sigma_C' = k_C + \mathbb{H}(\Sigma P || \Sigma R + \Sigma T
|| m) x_C\)</p>
<p>These can then be shared (all with all) and are verifiable in the same
way as previously, e.g.:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_A' G \stackrel{?}{=} R_A + \mathbb{H}(\Sigma P ||
\Sigma R + \Sigma T ||m) P_A \)</p>
<p>But, it seems to get a bit confusing when you ask what happens if one
party reveals either a full \(\sigma\) value, or a secret \(t\).</p>
<p>For example, what if Alice reveals her full partial signature (yes I
meant that!) \(\sigma_A =k_A + t_A + \mathbb{H}(...) x_A\)?</p>
<p>One partial signature on its own is not enough for Bob or Charlie to do
anything. If Alice <em>and</em> Bob do this, and pass these partials to
Charlie, then he can complete and publish. But we want atomicity. What
we want is:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the complete transaction signature is ever published, all parties
    can learn the adaptor secrets \(t\).</li>
<li>If any or all parties learn the adaptor secrets \(t\) they can
    publish the complete transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear why that's the desire: that would mean you could make
multiple different transactions, sharing the same set of adaptor
secrets, and have it so that <span
style="text-decoration: underline;">if one transaction gets published
all the others do!</span></p>
<p><strong>But wait!</strong> Something was horribly obfuscated in those bullet points.
"learn the adaptor secrets"? All of them, or which ones?<strong><span
style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong></p>
<p>That this is crucial is easily seen by considering the following
"attack":</p>
<p>Suppose Alice, Bob, Charlie make three transactions, each of which pays
out of a 3-of-3 Schnorr multisig, between them. The idea would be (as
you've probably gathered from the build-up) that if any 1 transaction,
say the first one paying Bob, gets broadcast, then both Alice and
Charlie could broadcast the other 2 transactions, paying each of them,
because they "learnt the adaptor secrets". But: if say Alice kicks off,
reveals her adaptor secret \(t_A\), then couldn't Bob and Charlie
collude? They could take the partial signature of Alice:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_A = k_A + t_A + \mathbb{H}(\ldots)x_A\)</p>
<p>and then between themselves share and construct their "joint" partial
signature:</p>
<p>\(\sigma_{BC} = k_B + k_C + t_B + t_C
+\mathbb{H}(\ldots)(x_B+x_C)\)</p>
<p>then add this to \(\sigma_A\). They could do this for the two
transactions paying <em>them</em> and publish them to the blockchain. It may
seem at first glance that this is a problem, because in doing so they
haven't revealed their <em>individual</em> adaptor secrets \(t_B, t_C\) but
have instead revealed their sum \(t_B+t_C\).</p>
<p>However this is not a problem! One way of looking at it is <strong>adaptor
signatures are just as linear as proper Schnorr signatures</strong>. They are
thus aggregatable. From Alice's point of view, although she is taking
part in a 3-of-3 Schnorr multisig, she may just as well be participating
in a 2-of-2 with a single party, if Bob and Charlie choose to collude
and combine in that way. What will Alice see on the blockchain?</p>
<p>\(\sigma = k_A + k_B + k_C + t_A + t_B + t_C +
\mathbb{H}(\ldots)(x_A+x_B+x_C)\)</p>
<p>But she already got adaptor signatures from Bob and Charlie, so she can
remove them:</p>
<p>\(\sigma - \sigma_A - \sigma_B' - \sigma_C' = t_B + t_C\).</p>
<p>Now possessing the value of the <em>sum</em> \(t_B+t_C\), she can add this
to pre-existing adaptor signatures for the transaction paying <em>her</em> and
get the complete multisignature on those!</p>
<p>Unfairly linear signatures for the win!</p>
<h2>Protocol Outline</h2>
<p>We've now covered the meat of the concepts; so this instantiation phase
will either be easy to follow, or, if you found the above slightly
opaque, will hopefully make it clearer by being more concrete.</p>
<p>We're now ready to outline this "multiparty SSSSSS" design :) We'll
break it into three phases.</p>
<p>Because 11 party would be too tedious, we'll stick to Alice, Bob,
Charlie three party case as above.</p>
<p>Getting clear on notation: \(D_x\) will be destination addresses,
transactions will be \(\tau_x\), adaptor secrets will be \(t_x\),
corresponding curve points: \(T_x\). Signatures will be
\(\sigma_x\) and adaptor signatures will be marked with a ', so
\(\sigma_{x}'\). The subscripts will almost always be one of \(A,
B, C\) for Alice, Bob, Charlie.</p>
<h2>Phase 1 - Setup</h2>
<p>We first negotiate three destination addresses: \(D_A, D_B, D_C\).
Here the subscripts denote the payer <strong>into</strong> the address. So after the
end of the setup the first will contain a coin paid by Alice, the second
by Bob and the third by Charlie. The preparation of these addresses/keys
will of course be done with Musig but to reiterate, we are ignoring the
complexity there.</p>
<p>The three parties then all provide signatures on backout transactions
such that each party gets their money back after a timeout. See the
section "Timing Controls" for more details on this.</p>
<p>Once backouts are presigned, all parties pay into the destinations as
above and wait for confirms.</p>
<p>Parties will agree in advance on the "shuffle"/permutation of coins,
i.e. who will be paying who; this is related to Timing Control, so
again, see that section. The exact negotiation protocol to decide the
permutation is left open here. Once agreed, we know that we are going to
be arranging three transactions paying out of \(D_A, D_B, D_C\),
we'll call these \(\tau_{AB}, \tau_{BC}, \tau_{CA}\)
respectively, where the second subscript indicates who receives the
coin.</p>
<h2>Phase 2 - Adaptors</h2>
<p>Each participant chooses randomly their adaptor secret \(t_A, t_B,
t_C\) and then shares \(T_A, T_B, T_C\) with all others
(<em>technical note: this might need to happen in setup phase</em>). They then
also <strong>all</strong> provide adaptor signatures on <strong>all</strong> of three transactions
\(\tau_{AB}, \tau_{BC}, \tau_{CA}\) to each other. Note that
there is no risk in doing so; the adaptor signatures are useless without
receiving the adaptor secrets. Now each party must make two checks on
each received adaptor signature:</p>
<ul>
<li>That it correctly matches the intended transaction \(\tau\) and
    the set of agreed keys in the setup</li>
<li>Crucially that <em>each</em> of the adaptor signatures from any
    counterparty correctly matches the same adaptor secret point
    \(T\).</li>
</ul>
<p>("Crucial" of course because without using the same adaptor secrets, we
don't get our desired atomicity across a set of transactions).</p>
<p>To be more concrete, here are the actions of Bob:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a single adaptor secret randomly: \(t_B
    \stackrel{$}{\leftarrow} \mathbb{Z}_N\)</li>
<li>Broadcast \(T_B = t_B G\) to Alice, Charlie</li>
<li>Having agreed on all three payout transactions \(\tau_{AB},
    \tau_{BC}, \tau_{CA}\), generate three adaptor signatures:
    \(\sigma_{B\tau_{AB}}' = k_{B\tau_{AB}} +
    \mathbb{H}(\Sigma P_{AB} || \Sigma R_{AB} + \Sigma T ||
    m_{\tau_{AB}}) x_{B\tau_{AB}}\), \(\sigma_{B\tau_{BC}}'
    = k_{B\tau_{BC}} + \mathbb{H}(\Sigma P_{BC} || \Sigma
    R_{BC} + \Sigma T || m_{\tau_{BC}}) x_{B\tau_{BC}}\),
    \(\sigma_{B\tau_{CA}}' = k_{B\tau_{CA}} +
    \mathbb{H}(\Sigma P_{CA} || \Sigma R_{CA} + \Sigma T ||
    m_{\tau_{CA}}) x_{B\tau_{CA}}\).</li>
<li>Broadcast these adaptors to Alice, Charlie.</li>
<li>Receive the 2 x 3 = 6 corresponding adaptors from Alice and Charlie.
    Verify each one (note the above bullet points).</li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming all parties accept the adaptor signatures, we are ready to
proceed to the last phase. If any communication or protocol failure
occurs, all parties must fall back to the backout transactions presigned
in the Setup phase.</p>
<p>(<em>Technical note: it is not necessary for all parties to share all
adaptors, in general, but for simplicity we use that model, since it
hurts nothing I believe)</em>.</p>
<h2>Phase 3 - Execution</h2>
<p>The order of events in this final execution phase is important for
safety, but we defer that to the next section "Timing Controls". Here
we'll just show how events will proceed if everything goes correctly, in
a randomly chosen order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice and Charlie send full partial(! i.e. not adaptor) signatures
    on \(\tau_{AB}\) to Bob, i.e. the transaction that pays Bob. So
    they send \(\sigma_{A\tau_{AB}}\) and
    \(\sigma_{C\tau_{AB}}\), respectively.</li>
<li>Bob can add this to his own full partial signature on the same
    transaction, constructing: \(\sigma_{\tau_{AB}}\) and using
    this to broadcast \(\tau_{AB}\) to the network, receiving his
    coin.</li>
<li>Alice will read \(\sigma_{C\tau_{AB}} + \sigma_{B\tau_{AB}}
    = \sigma_{\tau_{AB}} - \sigma_{A\tau_{AB}}\) from this
    broadcast signature and from this deduce the value of \(t_B+t_C =
    \sigma_{C\tau_{AB}} + \sigma_{B\tau_{AB}} -
    \sigma_{C\tau_{AB}}' + \sigma_{B\tau_{AB}}'\).</li>
<li>Alice can add this aggregated adaptor secret \(t_B+t_C\) to the
    pre-existing adaptors \(\sigma_{B\tau_{CA}}' +
    \sigma_{C\tau_{CA}}'\) to get \(\sigma_{B\tau_{CA}} +
    \sigma_{C\tau_{CA}}\), which she can then add to
    \(\sigma_{A\tau_{CA}}\) to get a fully valid
    \(\sigma_{\tau_{CA}}\) and broadcast this to the network to
    receive her 1 coin.</li>
<li>Charlie can do exactly the same as Alice for the last transaction,
    \(\tau_{BC}\) and receive his coin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus both other parties, after the first spend, were able to claim their
coin by creating complete signatures through combining the adaptor
signatures with the revealed (possibly aggregated) adaptor secrets.
(<em>Technical note: in a protocol we can allow participants to share
adaptor secrets at the appropriate times instead of having it deduced
from transaction broadcasts, as in the case of CoinSwap, just as a kind
of politeness, but this is not important</em>).</p>
<h2>Timing Controls</h2>
<p>In the 2 party scriptless script swap, as in earlier CoinSwap designs,
we simply account for the asymmetry of timing of revealing priviliged
information (e.g. signatures) using an asymmetry of timelocks. The one
who transfers something valuable first (a signature) must have an
earlier ability to refunds coins that are "stuck" due to protocol
non-completion, else the possessor of the adaptor secret / CoinSwap
secret, who does not reveal it first, may wait for the window where he
can reclaim and the other cannot, to both reclaim and use the secret to
steal the other's coins.</p>
<p>Here we must follow a similar principle, just extended to multiple
parties.</p>
<p>Suppose, naively, we just used the same locktime on each of the three
refund transactions.</p>
<p>Now suppose Alice, at the start of Phase 3, reveals her full signature
first, on transaction \(\tau_{AB}\) which pays Bob. And suppose for
maximal pessimism that Bob and Charlie are colluding to defraud Alice.
They will simply wait until the moment of the timeout and attempt to
cheat Alice: try to broadcast both of their own refunds, while spending
the transaction for which Alice provided the full signature (having done
so, she has revealed her adaptor secret to the other two).</p>
<p>Thus by instead making Alice's backout locktime the earliest, she is
safe in transferring her full signature, and thus her adaptor secret
first. In this case if Bob and Charlie collude, they can do no better
than publish this spend before that (earliest) timeout, and in so doing,
reveal the aggregate of their adaptor secrets atomically so Alice can
claim her money well before their backouts become active, as intended by
system design.</p>
<p>Now let's consider the second sender of a full signature, say it's Bob.
Suppose we let Charlie's locktime be identical to Bob's. And for maximal
pessimism let's say Alice and Charlie collude. Here, Charlie could
refuse to pass his signature to Bob and attempt to reclaim his coin at
the exact moment of the timeout, while spending Bob's (depending on the
exact permutation of spends, but at least, it's possible). Even though
Alice didn't back out at her timeout in this scenario, which is weird,
clearly this scenario is not safe for Bob, he has passed across a
signature to Charlie with no time based defence against him.</p>
<p>These considerations make it obvious, I think, that the obviously sound
way to do it is to stagger the locktime values according to the order in
which signatures, and therefore secrets, are revealed. If the order of
signature transfers is: first Alice, then Bob, then Charlie, then the
locktimes on the backouts which pay each must obey \(L_A &lt; L_B
&lt; L_C\).</p>
<p>So I believe this ordering must be settled on in Phase 1 (because we
define these locktimes before signing the backout transactions).</p>
<h2>Generalisation from 3-3 to N-N.</h2>
<p>I believe this is trivial, modulo practicality.</p>
<h2>Practical considerations, advantages</h2>
<p>The scenario described is a multiparty coinswap in which essentially a
group of \(N\) parties could randomly shuffle history of their coins.
This could be done with or without a coordinator (either Joinmarket
style or server style), could possibly be done with a Coinshuffle++ type
coordination mechanism and/or blinding.</p>
<p>Practicality: the biggest limitation is that of CoinSwap generally, but
extended further: using staggered locktime backouts means that in cases
of failure, participants may have to wait a long time for coin recovery.
This gets linearly worse with anonymity set, which is not good. Would
love to find a trick to avoid that.</p>
<p>Expanding further on that same limitation, a larger number of
participants makes worse the problem that I've previously called "XBI",
or "cross block interactivity". There's a lot of exposure to DOS attacks
and simple network failure when participants not only have to
coordinate, but have to do so more than once. This could partially be
addressed with incentives, e.g. fidelity bonds, but I'm not convinced.</p>
<p>On the positive side, there could be a tremendous boon over the 2-party
case in that it's possible here to have a group of anonymous
participants shuffle the history of their coins without any of the
parties knowing the others' linkages.</p>
<p>Also positively, such larger group swaps may offer much larger privacy
improvements in a very economical way (a few hundred bytes on chain per
participant vs tens or hundreds of kilobytes via coinjoin? complete
finger in the air here of course).</p>
<p>Leaving open: can amount decorrelation be achieved in a more powerful
way in this model? I believe so, for example by splitting amounts into
subsets across subsets of participants in interesting ways. Fees can
also be used for noise. I think the most powerful version of this model
would be very powerful indeed, but needs more detailed analysis, and
this blog post is already too long.</p>
<p>Other applications: also leaving this open. Perhaps using adaptor
signatures in groups like this (exploiting the linearity of adaptor
signatures) has applications to second layer tech like Lightning or
similar contracting.</p></div>
