&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background - what is the "gridchain case"?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reflection on a case of reported theft as outlined
&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/69duq9/50_bounty_for_anybody_recovering_445_btc_stolen/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
on reddit in early 2017 by user 'gridchain'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I won't do here is discuss the practical details of the case;
things like, whether it was a hack or an inside job, nor anything like
network level metadata, all of which is extremely important in an actual
criminal investigation. But here I'm only focusing on the role played
by Joinmarket specifically and blockchain level activity of the coins,
generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this blog post was
&lt;a href="https://research.oxt.me/the-cold-case-files/1"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
recent report by OXT Research - specifically by analyst
&lt;a href="https://bitcoinhackers.org/@ErgoBTC"&gt;ErgoBTC&lt;/a&gt;
(they require an email for signup to read the full report, otherwise you
only see the summary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short note of thanks here to ErgoBTC and LaurentMT and others
involved, since this kind of detailed analysis is badly needed, I hope
will we see more, specifically in public, over time (we cannot hope for
such from the deeply unethical blockchain analysis companies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm [not]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} going to assume here
that you've read that report in full, but I am going to be referring to
its main set of conclusions, and analyzing them. Obviously if you want
to properly assess my statements, it's rather difficult - you'd need
full knowledge of Joinmarket's operation &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; full details of the OXT
Research analysis - and even then, like me, you will still have some
significant uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the case starts with the claimed theft in 2 parts: 45 BTC in &lt;a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/2f9bfc5f23b609f312faa60902022d6583136cc8e8a0aecf5213b41964963881"&gt;this
txn&lt;/a&gt;
(note I will use blockstream.info for my tx links because I find their
presentation easiest for single txs specifically; note that oxt.me 's
research tool is of course a vastly superior way to see a large network
of txs, which plays a crucial role in this analysis), and a
consolidation of 400BTC in &lt;a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/136d7c862267204c13fec539a89c7b9b44a92538567e1ebbce7fc9dd04c5a7f0"&gt;this other
txn&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll assume that both of these utxos are under the control of a single
actor/thief, henceforth just &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting aside the (in some ways remarkable) timing - that &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; did not
move the coins for about 2 years - let's outline roughly what happened,
and what the report tells us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 400BTC went into joinmarket as a maker, and did a bunch (11 to
    be precise) of transactions that effectively "peeled down" (more
    on this later) that 400 to perhaps 335 BTC (with the difference
    going into coinjoins).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; then switched to a taker role for a while, focusing on higher
    denominations, ranging from \~ 6BTC to as high as \~58BTC. Many of
    these coinjoins had very low counterparty numbers (say 3-5 being
    typical).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At some point some maker activity is seen again in this same
    "peeling chain"; the report terms this phase as "alternating",
    but it's hard to say for sure whether some particular script is
    running, whether &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; is just randomly switching roles, or what.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware that this simplified narrative suggests to the careless reader
that one can easily trace all the coins through all the coinjoins, which
of course is not true at all - each subsequent transaction moves some
portion into a "mixed state", but (a) we'll see later that just
"moved into mixed state" is not the end of the story for some of those
coins and (b) while this narrative is misleading for Joinmarket in
general, it is not &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; misleading in this particular case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction between the "second" and "third" phase as listed in
those bullet points is pretty much arbitrary, but what is not in doubt
as important is: that second phase marks a clear jump in coinjoin amount
average size (this could be read as impatience on &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;'s part - but
that's just speculation), and this resulted in small anonymity sets in
some txs - 4 and 3 in two txs, in particular. Let's continue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the second regime, the OXT analysis narrows in on those small
    anon set, large denomination txs - can they figure out which equal
    sized output belongs to &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; here? The "toxic replay attack"
    (explained below) allows them to identify one coinjoin output
    unambiguously  - but that goes into another coinjoin. But in a
    second case it allows them to reduce the anonymity set (of the equal
    sized coinjoin outputs) to 2, and they trace forwards both of those
    outputs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of those 2 coinjoin outputs (&lt;a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/2dc4e88685269795aafe7459087ab613878ce7d857dd35760eefeb9caf21371b"&gt;this
    txn&lt;/a&gt;
    , output index 2) pays, after several hops, into a Poloniex deposit
    address in &lt;a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/ab1e604cd959cc94b89ab02b691fe7d727d30637284e5e82908fb28b8db378f4"&gt;this
    txn&lt;/a&gt;
    ). Although this is several hops, and although it does not deposit
    all of that \~58BTC into Poloniex (only about half of it),
    nevertheless this can be (and is) treated as a significant lead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So the next step was to trace back from that specific Poloniex
    deposit address, which it turned out had a bunch of activity on it.
    See
    &lt;a href="https://blockstream.info/address/16vBEuZD54NzqnnSStPYxFF2aktGhhuaf1"&gt;16vBEuZD54NzqnnSStPYxFF2aktGhhuaf1&lt;/a&gt;
    . Indeed several other deposits to that single address are connected
    to the same Joinmarket cluster, and specifically connected to those
    smaller-anon set taker-side coinjoins. In total around 270BTC is
    eventually linked from &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;'s joinmarket coinjoins to that deposit
    address. Even though some of those connections are ambiguous, due to
    address reuse the evidence of co-ownership appears very strong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some further evidence is provided (though I am still fuzzy on the
    details, largely just because of the time needed to go through it
    all) linking more of the coins to final destinations, including some
    from the 45BTC original chunk. The claim is that 380BTC is linked at
    final destinations to the original 445BTC set. In the remainder
    I'll focus on what is already seen with this 270BTC set and only
    peripherally mention the rest - there is already a lot to chew on!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="change-peeling"&gt;Toxic change and peeling chains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea of a "peeling chain" on the Bitcoin blockchain isn't
too hard to understand. Given 100 BTC in a single utxo, if I have to
make a monthly payment of 1 BTC and never use my wallet otherwise, then
clearly the tx sequence is (using (input1, input2..):(output1,
output2..)) as a rudimentary format): ((100):(1,99), (99):(1, 98),
(98:(1, 97)...). Ignoring fees of course. What matters here is that I
just always have a single utxo and that on the blockchain &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; utxos
&lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be linked as (100-99-88-97...) based on a &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Change_address_detection"&gt;change
heuristic&lt;/a&gt;
such as "round amount for payment". To whatever extent change
heuristics work, then to that extent ownership can be traced through
simple payments (especially and mostly if transactions have exactly two
outputs, so that the very &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of change, let alone a change
heuristic, applies straightforwardly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="peeling chain simple
example" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200713230834im_/https://joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/PeelingChain1.png/PeelingChain1-418x296.png"&gt;{width="418"
height="296"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In peeling chains, sometimes, the primary heuristic is the &lt;strong&gt;size&lt;/strong&gt; of
the output. If you start with 1000 btc and you peel 0.1 btc hundreds of
times, it's obvious from the "size pattern" what the change is (and
indeed it's this case that gives rise to the name &lt;em&gt;peel chain&lt;/em&gt; because
"peel" refers to taking off a &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt; part of something, usually its
surface). The above diagram is more similar (but not the same, exactly)
as the initial flow in the gridchain case, with one very large utxo
gradually getting peeled off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases timing may factor in; sometimes hackers will do hundreds
of such peels off a main originating utxo in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can think of a peeling chain as the lowest effort ownership
obfuscation out there. Notice how literally any, even the simplest,
Bitcoin wallet, has to offer the feature required to carry this out -
just make a vanilla payment, for which there is (almost always, but not
always) a change output, back to your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in Bitcoin's history, this technique has very often been seen used -
by hackers/thieves moving coins "away" from the original site of the
theft (I remember the &lt;a href="http://www.techienews.co.uk/973470/silk-road-like-sheep-marketplace-scams-users-39k-bitcoins-worth-40-million-stolen/"&gt;case of Sheep
Market&lt;/a&gt;
for example). Each "peel" raises additional uncertainty; the
non-change output is going somewhere, but who owns that? But the change
outputs represent a link allowing someone, in theory, to keep tracing
the activity of the original actor. Notice here how we talk about one
branch (our ((100):(1,99), (99):(1, 98), (98:(1, 97)...) example
illustrates it); but one could keep tracing the payment outputs (the
'1's in that flow) and see if they themselves form other peel chains,
leading to a tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We mentioned a 'change heuristic' element to this - which is the
"main branch" if we're not sure which output is the change?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="change-joinmarket"&gt;Change outputs in a Joinmarket context&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reader should from this point probably be familiar with the basics of
Joinmarket's design. Apart from the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Joinmarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="hhttps://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md"&gt;usage
guide&lt;/a&gt;
of the main Joinmarket code repo, the diagrams showing the main
Joinmarket transaction types
&lt;a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/JMPrivacyAnalysis/blob/master/tumbler_privacy.md#joinmarket-transaction-types"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
may be useful as a refresher or a reference point for the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have: \(N\) equal outputs and \(N\) or \(N-1\) non-equal change
outputs, where \(N-1\) happens when the taker does a "sweep",
emptying the mixdepth (= account; joinmarket wallets have 5 accounts by
default) without a change output. [This last feature is specific to
Joinmarket, and specific to the taker role: there's no other coinjoin
out there that provides the facility to sweep an arbitrary amount of
coins out to an equal-sized output, with no
change.]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} (I am emphasizing this not
for marketing, but because it's crucial to this topic, and not widely
understood I think).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of why it's important, here is one line from the OXT
Research article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fees taken directly in a mix transaction result in deterministic
links ("unmixed change").&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is false as an absolute statement; fees can be paid by a taker,
inside the transaction, with no unmixed change for the taker (this is
the Joinmarket 'sweep'). Deterministic links between inputs and change
outputs &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; result from change, and fees &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; create an additional flag
that can help make those linkages, in cases where there would be more
ambiguity. But a zero fee coinjoin with change outputs still has
deterministic links, usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does the OXT Research article heavily focus on &lt;em&gt;toxic unmixed
change&lt;/em&gt; as a concept and as a key weakness of such protocols as
Joinmarket, and why do I disagree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we discussed peeling chains offer a low quality of obfuscation, and
to unpack that: the problem is that if you have any relatively viable
change heuristic (it doesn't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be large amounts as discussed),
it can let you keep knowledge of ownership of a whole chain of
transactions. That basically gives the blockchain analyst (we'll call
&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) a very large attack surface. He can look at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the information
flowing out of, or associated with, a whole chain of transactions. Any
later recombination of outputs from that "large attack surface" is
either a coinjoin or a "smoking gun" that different outward paths were
actually under the control of one owner (this comes back to that central
heuristic - common input ownership, and all the nuance around that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Joinmarket or any other coinjoin protocol that does allow change
outputs, "change heuristic" doesn't really apply, it kind of morphs
into something else: it's very obvious which outputs are change, but it
is only &lt;em&gt;in some cases&lt;/em&gt; easy to disentangle which change outputs are
associated to which inputs, and that's actually what you need to know
if you want to trace via the change (as per "peeling chains"
description above). In high anonymity sets, it starts to get difficult
to do that disentangling, but more on that ("sudoku") later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis done in the OXT Research report smartly combines a long
peeling chain with other specific weaknesses in the way &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; acted, which
we will discuss in the next section.. So all this is very valid in my
view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[But I think going from the above to the conclusion "coinjoins which
have unmixed change are fundamentally inferior and not viable, compared
to coinjoins without unmixed change" is just flat out
wrong]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}. Consider yourself in the
position of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;. You have let's say 400BTC in a single utxo. If you run
a coinjoin protocol that insists on no change always, and without a
market mechanism, you are forced to use a fixed denomination, say 0.1
BTC (an example that seems common), now across thousands of
transactions. In order to create these fixed denomination utxos you are
faced with the same problem of trying to avoid a trivial peeling chain.
By insisting on no deterministic links within the coinjoin, you simply
move the problem to an earlier step, you do not remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed denomination does not solve the problem of having an unusually
large amount to mix compared to your peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, fixed denomination with no change at all, does create
other advantages - I certainly don't mean to disparage that model!
Without going into detail here, consider that a large set or network of
all-equal-in all-equal-out coinjoins can create similar effects to a
single, much larger, coinjoin (but this is a topic for another article).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="toxic-recall"&gt;The toxic recall attack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier we explained that one of the steps of the OXT Research analysis
was to identify a low liquidity regime where &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; was acting as taker,
and we mentioned the "toxic recall attack" was used to reduce the
anonymity sets of the coinjoin outputs, during this, to a level low
enough that simple enumeration could find good candidates for final
destinations of those coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded in this was a crucial piece of reasoning, and I think this was
a both excellent, and very important idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joinmarket does not allow co-spending of utxos from different
    accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That means that if a coinjoin output &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is spent along with a utxo
    from the "peeling chain" (i.e. they are both inputs to the same
    tx), then &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is not owned by &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (assuming correct identification
    of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;'s peeling chain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every time such an event occurs, that &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; can be crossed off the
    list of coinjoin outputs that &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; might own, thus reducing the
    anonymity set of that earlier coinjoin by 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning is not perfectly watertight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, as the report observes: the first assumption behind it is "A
user can only run one mixing client at a time." This is clearly not
literally true, but like many things here, a good-enough guess is fine,
if it eventually leads to outcomes that further strengthen the case. And
that is definitely true here: while a smart operator probably would be
running more than one instance of Joinmarket code, it is not default
behaviour and requires both a little coding and some careful thought.
Most people would not do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Second, nothing stops a user from making a coinjoin to an address in
the same mixdepth (at least in the current software). It's just that
(a) that is heavily discouraged and (b) it's not easy to see a good
reason why someone would &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to do that. Still it is possible as a
mistake. But I don't think this is a reason to doubt the effectiveness
of the "toxic recall attack", just, it should be noted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall the bolded sentence is the most interesting - Joinmarket's
intention is to prevent co-spending outputs which would ruin the effect
of any single coinjoin - i.e. it tries (caveat: above parenthetical) to
prevent you using both a coinjoin output and the change output (or any
other utxo in the same account as the change output and the original
inputs) together. And this small element of 'rigidity' in how coins
are selected for spending is actually another 'bit' of information
that &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt; can use to make deductions, at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following diagram tries to illustrate how these conditions lead to
the possibility of the attack, to reduce the anonymity set of coinjoin
outputs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Toxic recall attack
illustration" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200713230834im_/https://joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/ToxicRecall1.png/ToxicRecall1-692x490.png"&gt;{width="692"
height="490"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary we see 4 really important factors leading to the attack's
viability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joinmarket's strict account separation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linkability via change - as we'll describe in the next section
    "Joinmarket sudoku", this is &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; but not always possible, so
    while (1) was 99% valid this is more like 75% valid (entirely vague
    figures of course).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reusing the same peers in different coinjoin transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low number of peers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, 3 and 4 are closely tied together; reuse of peers happened a
lot precisely because there were so few peers available for large
coinjoin sizes (to remind you, it was between 6 and 58 BTC, and the
average was around 27, and there are/were few Joinmarket peers actually
offering above say 10BTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="size-factor"&gt;The size factor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a thread that's run through the above, but let's be clear
about it: in practice, typical Joinmarket coinjoins run from 0.1 to 10
BTC, which is unsurprising. There are a fair number of much smaller
transactions, many just functioning as tests, while &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; small
amounts are not very viable due to the fees paid by the taker to the
bitcoin network. Larger than 10 BTC are certainly seen, including up to
50 BTC and even beyond, but they appear to be quite rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions of &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; in this regard were clearly suboptimal. They started
by taking 4 x 100 BTC outputs and consolidating them into 1 output of
400 BTC. This was not helpful, if anything the opposite should have been
done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, as a consequence, they placed the entirety of this (I'm
ignoring the 45 BTC output for now as it's not that crucial) in one
mixdepth. For smaller amounts where a user is just casually offering
coins for joining, one output is fine, and will rapidly be split up
anyway, but here this very large size [led to most of the large-ish
joining events forming part of one long peeling
chain&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} This part probably isn't
clear so let me illustrate. A yield generator/maker usually splits up
its coins into random chunks pretty quickly, and while as a maker they
do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; get the crucial "sweep, no change" type of transaction
mentioned above, they nevertheless do get fragmentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Initial deposit --&amp;gt; After 1 tx --&amp;gt; After 2 txs --&amp;gt; After many txs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0: 1BTC         --&amp;gt; 0.800 BTC  --&amp;gt; 0.800 BTC   --&amp;gt; 0.236 BTC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1: 0 BTC        --&amp;gt; 0.205 BTC  --&amp;gt; 0.110 BTC   --&amp;gt; 0.001 BTC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2: 0 BTC        --&amp;gt; 0.000 BTC  --&amp;gt; 0.100 BTC   --&amp;gt; 0.555 BTC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3: 0 BTC        --&amp;gt; 0.000 BTC  --&amp;gt; 0.000 BTC   --&amp;gt; 0.129 BTC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;4: 0 BTC        --&amp;gt; 0.000 BTC  --&amp;gt; 0.000 BTC   --&amp;gt; 0.107 BTC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Final total is a bit more than 1BTC due to fees; the reason it gets
jumbled, with no ordering, is: each tx moves coinjoin output to &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt;
mixdepth, mod 5 (ie it wraps), but when a new tx request comes in it
might be for any arbitrary size, so the mixdepth used as &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; of
coins for that next transaction, could be any of them. This is
illustrated in the 'after 2 txs' case: the second mixdepth was chosen
as input to the second tx, not the first mixdepth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dynamic does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; remove the "peeling chain" or "toxic
change" dynamic emphasized in OXT Research's report - because every tx
done by the maker still has its change, [precisely because as maker you
don't have the privilege of choosing the
amount]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it does result in more so to speak "parallelisation" of the mixing
activity, instead of the largest chunk all being in one long chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question remains, if we imagine that we use much smaller amounts - can
the analyst always follow the "peeling chain of each mixdepth" (to
coin a phrase which at this point hopefully makes sense)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think actually the answer is more 'no' than you might at first
think. The next section will illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sudoku"&gt;Joinmarket sudoku.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept including its origination is covered in some detail in my
earlier article
&lt;a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/JMPrivacyAnalysis/blob/master/tumbler_privacy.md#jmsudoku-coinjoin-sudoku-for-jmtxs"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Essentially we are talking about making unambiguous linkages between
change outputs and the corresponding inputs in any given Joinmarket
coinjoin. I reproduce one transaction diagram from that article here to
help the reader keep the right idea in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Coinjoin
canonical" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200713230834im_/https://joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/cjmtx.svg"&gt;{width="550"
height="389"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to effect this "sudoku" or disentangling, let's suppose you don't
have any sophistication. You're just going to iterate over every
possible subset of the inputs (they're randomly ordered, of course) and
see if it matches any particular change output (you assume that there is
exactly one change output per participant). In case it wasn't obvious,
"matches" here means "that change output, plus the coinjoin size (3
btc in the diagram above), equals the sum of the subset of inputs".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now none of them will &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; match because there are fees of two
types being paid out of (and into) the change - the bitcoin network fees
and the coinjoin fees (which add to most and subtract from one, at least
usually). So since you don't know the exact values of those fees, only
a general range, you have to include a "tolerance" parameter, which
really complicates the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/15223a5eab940559e5cf55e898354978"&gt;This
gist&lt;/a&gt;
is a quick and dirty (in the sense it's barely a 'program' since i
just hardcoded the values of the transaction) example of doing such a
Joinmarket sudoku for one of the transactions in the OXT Research
analysis of flows for this case. The pythonistas out there might find of
interest particularly this code snippet for finding the "power set"
(the set of all subsets):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;def power_set(l):&lt;/code&gt;\
&lt;code&gt;iil = range(len(l))&lt;/code&gt;\
&lt;code&gt;return list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(iil, r) for r in range(len(iil)+1)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per a very beautiful piece of mathematical reasoning, the power set
of a set of size \(N\) is \(2\^{N}\) (every member of set is either
in, or not in, each subset - think about it!). So this matters because
it illustrates, crudely, how we have here an exponential blowup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That particular transaction had 24 inputs, so the power set's
cardinality would be \(2\^{24}\) - but the beginning of the analysis
is to take a subset, of size 4, you already conclude to be linked, thus
reducing the size of the search space by a factor of 16. Now, there's a
lot more to it, but, here's what's interesting: &lt;strong&gt;depending on the
tolerance you choose, you will often find there are multiple sudoku
solutions&lt;/strong&gt; if the size of the set of inputs is reasonably large (let's
say 20 and up, but it isn't possible to fix a specific number of
course). In the first couple of attempts of finding the solution for
that transaction, I found between 3 and 7 different possible ways the
inputs and outputs could connect; some of them involve the pre-grouped 4
inputs acting as taker (i.e. paying fees) and some involve them acting
as maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if this ambiguity isn't enough, there's another significant
source of ambiguity in these sudokus: previous equal-sized coinjoin
outputs. For example take &lt;a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/5f8747a3837a56dd2f422d137b96b1420fd6885be6d1057f3c4dca102a3138b6?output:5"&gt;this
txn&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="un-sudoku-able
tx" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20200713230834im_/https://joinmarket.me/static/media/uploads/.thumbnails/tx5f8747.png/tx5f8747-849x617.png"&gt;{width="849"
height="617"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 21 inputs, which is already in the "problematic" zone for
sudoku-ing, as discussed, in that it will tend to lead to multiple
possible solutions, with a reasonable tolerance parameter. But in this
case a full sudoku is fundamentally impossible: notice that inputs index
7 and 21 (counting from 0) both have amount 6.1212 . This means that any
subset that includes the first is identical to a subset that includes
the second. Those two outputs are, unsurprisingly, from the same
previous Joinmarket coinjoin (they don't have to be, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any long "peeling chain" these ambiguities will degrade, perhaps
destroy, the signal over time - unless there is some very strong
watermark effect - such as huge size, which is precisely what we see
with &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we these key points about the Sudoku concept for
identifying chains of ownership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As long as you don't sweep, a Joinmarket account, thus not emptied,
    will keep creating this chain of ownership via change - though the
    size of that linked amount dwindles over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus makers (who cannot sweep) have no guarantee of not having that
    specific ownership trace persist, for each of their 5 accounts (but
    &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; across them - the 5 accounts will not be connected on chain,
    at least not in a trivial way).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use a very large size then this acts as a strong enough
    watermark that such tracing is pretty much guaranteed to work (i.e
    the Sudoku works much more reliably if you put in a 400BTC utxo and
    everyone else in the coinjoin only uses 10BTC at max).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, and in general, such tracing is a bit unreliable, and
    over a long series of transactions it becomes very unreliable (but
    again - this is no kind of privacy guarantee! - we just observe that
    there will be increasing uncertainty over a long chain, including
    really fundamental ambiguities like the transaction above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; sweep, you create what I called in the previous
    article a &lt;a href="https://github.com/AdamISZ/JMPrivacyAnalysis/blob/master/tumbler_privacy.md#joinmarket-wallet-closures"&gt;"completed mixdepth
    closure"&lt;/a&gt;;
    there is no change for you as taker, and so an end to that
    "chain". This only exists for takers. (you can of course sweep
    &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; coinjoin at all, also).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="maker-taker"&gt;Reminder on the maker-taker tradeoff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates another aspect of the more general phenomenon -
Joinmarket almost by definition exists to serve takers. They pay for
these advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As coordinator, they do not reveal linkages to their counterparties.
    Makers must accept that the taker in each individual coinjoin &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;
    know &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; linkages (the maker's), even if they're OK with that
    over a long period because there are many disparate takers; that's
    a weakness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They choose the time when the coinjoin happens (within a minute or
    so, it's done, if all goes well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They choose the amount of the coinjoin, so can have a payment as a
    coinjoin outpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corollary of the above: they can control the size of their change,
    in particular, reducing it to zero via a "sweep"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since they run only when they want to coinjoin, they have a smaller
    time footprint for attackers (makers have an "always on hot
    wallet" &lt;em&gt;which responds to requests rather than initiates them&lt;/em&gt; ,
    so it's more like a server than a client, which is by definition
    difficult to keep properly secure).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 4+ advantages are what the Taker pays for, and it's interesting
that in practice that the &lt;em&gt;coinjoin&lt;/em&gt; fee has fallen to near-zero
&lt;strong&gt;except for larger sizes&lt;/strong&gt; .I will point to my earlier thoughts on low
fees
&lt;a href="https://x0f.org/web/statuses/104123055565241054"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
to avoid further sidetrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the cool sounding idea "oh I have this bunch of bitcoin
sitting around, I'll just passively mix it for a while and actually get
paid to do it!" (I have noticed people &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; get interested in
Joinmarket from this perspective) is more limited than it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Address reuse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will probably be the shortest section because it's so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that 270BTC of the 445 BTC going "into" Joinmarket ended up
at &lt;code&gt;16vBEuZD54NzqnnSStPYxFF2aktGhhuaf1&lt;/code&gt;is kind of a big facepalm moment;
I don't think anyone reading this blog would have trouble understanding
that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't dismiss or ignore that such things happen for a reason, and
that reason is mainly actions of centralized exchanges to deliberately
reduce the privacy of their customers ("KYC/AML"). Sometimes, of
course, sheer incompetence is involved. But it's the exception rather
than the rule, since even the most basic consumer wallets do not
generally reuse addresses nowadays. I'll consider these real world
factors out-of-scope of this article, although they will matter in your
practical real life decisions about keeping your privacy (consider &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
using such exchanges).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has to be said though: 270 does not equal 445 (or 400); it is not
impossible to imagine that such a set of deposits to one address may not
be traced/connected to the original deposit of 400 (+) into Joinmarket
(although it would really help if that total wasn't so very large that
there are only a few Joinmarket participants in that range anyway). And
indeed, my own examination of the evidence tells me that the connections
of each individual final deposit to
`16vBEuZD54NzqnnSStPYxFF2aktGhhuaf1```back to that original 445 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
unambiguous. The problem is of course the compounding effect of
evidence, as we will discuss in the next, final section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary; lessons learned; advice to users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've looked into details, can we summarize what went wrong for &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;?
Albeit we don't actually know with certainty how much of the
attributions in the OXT Research are correct, they appear to be &lt;em&gt;broadly
correct&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;400 BTC is a very large amount to move through a system of perhaps
    at best a couple hundred users (100 makers on the offer at once is
    typical), most of whom are not operating with more than 10 BTC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One large chunk of 400 is therefore a way worse idea than say 10
    chunks of 40 across 10 Joinmarket wallets (just common sense really,
    although starting with 400 is not in itself a disaster, it just
    makes it harder, and slower). This would have been more hassle, and
    more fees, but would have helped an awful lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running passively as a maker proved too slow for &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; (this is an
    assumption that the report makes and that I agree with, but not of
    course a 'fact'). This is Joinmarket's failing if anything; there
    are just not enough people using it, which relates to the next
    point:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When switching to a taker mode (which in itself was a very good
    idea), &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; decided to start doing much larger transaction sizes, but
    found themselves unable to get more than a few counterparties in
    some cases. This should have been a sign that the effect they were
    looking for might not be strong enough, but it's very
    understandable that they didn't grok the next point:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "toxic replay attack" very heavily compounds the low anonymity
    set problem mentioned above - reuse of the same counterparties in
    successive transactions reduced the anonymity set from "bad" to
    "disastrously low" (even down to 1 in one case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even with the above failings, all needn't really be lost; repeated
    rounds are used and the '1' anonymity set mentioned output was
    sent to another coinjoin anyway. The first chunk of coins identified
    to be sent to Poloniex address (first to be identified, not first in
    time) was in an amount of about 28 BTC via several hops, then part
    of the 76 BTC in &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200713230834/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/the-445-btc-gridchain-case/%22https://blockstream.info/tx/ab1e604cd959cc94b89ab02b691fe7d727d30637284e5e82908fb28b8db378f4"&gt;this
    txn&lt;/a&gt;,
    and even the first hop only had a 50% likelihood assigned. So it's
    a combination of (a) the address being marked as in the POLONIEX
    cluster, the size of the deposit and then the reuse allowing tracing
    back to other transactions, that caused a "high-likelihood
    assignment of ownership", which leads into ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address reuse as discussed in the previous section is the biggest
    failing here. If all the deposits here were to different exchange
    addresses, these heuristics would not have led to any clear
    outcomes. A few guesses here and there would exist, but they would
    remain guesses, with other possibilities also being reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Circling back to the beginning, notice how making educated guesses
    about deposits on exchanges a few hops away from Joinmarket might
    already be enough to get some decent guesses at ownership, if the
    sizes are large enough compared to the rest of the Joinmarket usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So overall the post mortem is: &lt;strong&gt;a combination of at least three
different things leads to a bad outcome for &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; : large (much bigger
than typical JM volume) size not split up, heavy address reuse (on a
centralized exchange) and a small anonymity set portion of the
sequence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This issue of "combination of factors" leading to a much worse than
expected privacy loss is explained well on the bitcoin wiki Privacy page
&lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy#Method_of_data_fusion"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="already"&gt;Already implemented improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When running as a taker and using the so-called &lt;a href="https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/tumblerguide.md"&gt;tumbler
algorithm&lt;/a&gt;
users should note that in 2019 a fairly meaningful change to the
algorithm was implemented - one part was to start each run with a sweep
transaction out of each mixdepth containing coins as the first step
(with longer randomized waits). This makes a peeling chain direct from a
deposit not possible (you can always try to guess which coinjoin output
to hop to next of course, with the concomitant difficulties).
Additionally average requested anonymity sets are increased, which, as
an important byproduct tends to create larger input sets which are
harder to sudoku (and more likely to have substantial ambiguity). There
are several other minor changes like rounding amounts, see &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/7e92810f07328fdfdef2ce444aad0968"&gt;Chris
Belcher's document on
it&lt;/a&gt;
for more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="still-needed"&gt;Still needed improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly the toxic recall attack concept matters - it is going to matter
more, statistically, as the anonymity set (i.e. the number of coinjoin
counterparties) is reduced, but it matters per se in any context -
reusing the same counterparties &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;in a sequence of coinjoins from the
same mixdepth closure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; reduces the anonymity set. Notice there are a
couple of ways that situation could be remediated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce the number of coinjoin transactions within the same mixdepth
    closure - but this is not clear. If I do 1 coinjoin transaction with
    10 counterparties and it's a sweep, closing the mixdepth closure,
    is that better than doing 2 coinjoin transactions from it, each of
    which has 6 counterparties, if there is a 10% chance of randomly
    choosing the same counterparty and thus reducing the anonymity set
    of the second coinjoin by 1? That is pretty profoundly unclear and
    seems to just "depend". 1 transaction with 12 counterparties &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
    clearly better, but very large sets like that are very difficult to
    achieve in Joinmarket today (particularly if your coinjoin amount is
    large).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively try to prevent reusing the same counterparty for multiple
    transactions in the same mixdepth closure (obviously this is for
    takers; makers are not choosing, they are offering). Identification
    of bots is problematic, so probably the best way to do this is
    simply for a taker to keep track of its earlier txs (especially
    within a tumbler run, say) and decide to not include makers when
    they provide utxos that are recognized as in that set. This is still
    a bit tricky in practice; makers don't want their utxos queried all
    the time, but takers for optimal outcomes would like full
    transparent vision into those utxo sets - see &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200713230834/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/poodle/"&gt;earlier discussion of
    PoDLE&lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200713230834/https://joinmarket.me/blog/blog/racing-against-snoopers-in-joinmarket-02/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
    on this blog for the tricky points around this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) is an example of ideas that were discussed by Joinmarket
developers years ago, but never really went anywhere. Takers probably
&lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; expand the query power given them by the PoDLE tokens to have a
larger set of options to choose from, to gauge the "quality" of what
their counterparties propose as join inputs, but it's a delicate
balancing act, as mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="recommendations"&gt;Recommendations for users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the final section, some practical advice. Joinmarket can be a
powerful tool - but it's unfortunately not very easy to understand what
you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do, precisely because there is a lot of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The taker role, and in particular the tumbler role, are designed to
    be used to actively improve your privacy. We explain above that it
    gives certain advantages over the maker role. So: &lt;strong&gt;use it!&lt;/strong&gt; - with
    at least the default settings for counterparty numbers and
    transaction numbers, and long waits - in fact, increase these
    factors above the defaults. Note that tumbles can be safely
    restarted, so do it for a day, shut it down and then restart it a
    few days later - that's fine. See the docs for more on that. Be
    sensitive to bitcoin network fees - these transactions are very
    large so they'll be more palatable at times when the network is
    clearing 1-5 sats/byte. However ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... mixing roles definitely has advantages. The more people mix
    roles the more unsafe it is to make deductions about which coinjoin
    output belonged to the taker, after it gets spent (consider what you
    can deduce about a coinjoin output which is then spent via an
    ordinary wallet, say to a t-shirt merchant).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The maker role isn't useless for privacy, it's rather best to
    think of it as (a) limited and (b) taking a long time to have an
    effect. It's most suitable if your threat model is "I don't want
    a clear history of my coins over the long term". It also costs
    nothing monetarily and brings in some very small income if your size
    is large (if small, it's likely not worth mentioning) - but in that
    case, take your security seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider sizing when acting as a taker. We as a project should
    perhaps create more transparency around this, but you can gauge from
    your success in arranging big size coinjoins: if you can't easily
    find 6+ counterparties to do a coinjoin at a particular size, it may
    not be a good idea to rely on the outcomes, as you may be mixing in
    too small of a crowd (whether that's at 10 BTC or 20 BTC or 50+ BTC
    just depends on market condition).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make good use of (a) the accounts (mixdepths) feature, (b) the coin
    freeze feature and (c) the sweep feature (taker only). These three
    things allow you to better isolate coins going to different
    destinations - your cold wallet, your mobile spending wallet, an
    exchange etc etc. Accounts let you have the assurance that coins in
    one aren't linked with coins in another; you can't accidentally
    co-spend them. The freeze feature (see the "Coins" tab on Qt) lets
    you spend individual utxos, where that's important to you for some
    reason, without connection to others. And the sweep feature lets you
    make a coinjoin without any change, breaking a link to future
    transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon (in 0.7.0; the code is basically already done) hope to have more
helpful features, in particular Payjoin as defined in BIP 78, along with
very basic PSBT support.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Joinmarket"></category><category term="coinjoin"></category></entry><entry><title>My super title</title><link href="/blog/blog/my-super-post" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-03T10:20:00+02:00</published><updated>2010-10-04T18:40:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Alexis Metaireau</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-10-03:/blog/blog/my-super-post</id><summary type="html">&lt;p class="first last"&gt;Short version for index and feeds&lt;/p&gt;
